# The login screen's background: the crown the boot splash ends on, without the gem, so the handover from
# Plymouth to GDM is one picture carried across. branding/generate.mjs draws it. GNOME reads it from inside
# GNOME Shell's own theme bundle and nowhere else, which the helper rebuilds with it; an image of one's own
# built on this one puts its picture there with the same helper (amethystora-brand). The helper also gives the lock
# screen its look, which no extension reaches: the large clock and date in Quicksand, and its cards of glass. It checks
# both in the rebuilt bundle, and Quicksand is installed by then (09-fonts.sh).
