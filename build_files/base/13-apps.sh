# The Amethystora apps: the Manual (Super+F1), Security, Updates, Notes, Logs, Backups, Control and Phone. They are
# one program, written in Rust with GTK 4 and libadwaita (apps/), which the Containerfile's apps stage built
# on this same base, and which picks the app by the name it is started as: each app's own path is a hard
# link to it, so that /usr/bin/amethystora-<app>, the process names and the launchers stay as they were.
# What else the apps need is in system_files already: each app's translations in
# /usr/lib/amethystora-<app>/resources/app/locale, where Weblate writes them (CONTRIBUTING.md), the manual's
# pages in /usr/share/amethystora/manual, and the launchers.
#
#   - Quicksand, the face of the Amethystora wordmark, which the windows draw it in. The image has no system
#     copy of it; the Containerfile brings branding/fonts into the build context.
#   - The licences of the Rust crates built into the program, beside the list of them (CRATES).

# The file-watch sensor is a binary of its own (no GTK), not one of the windowed apps: it loads a BPF object

# Amethystora's own code, dual-licensed so it may use the kernel's GPL-only BPF helpers; the Rust crates

# The AI agent's tools (no GTK either): the MCP server the launcher gives each agent, and the model its search
