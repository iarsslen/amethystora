# amethystora-audit-home-rules (/usr/libexec/amethystora-audit-home-rules, or the copy named first) against
# a stand-in /etc/passwd and /var/home, for 20-tests.sh. It runs as root at every boot, so: it gives an
# account back what an older version left to root inside its home, and it never follows a link the account
# made out of the home, neither to change an owner nor to write a watch, nor writes a rule auditctl cannot
# read. Runs as root, as the generator does.
