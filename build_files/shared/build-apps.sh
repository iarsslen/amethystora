# The Containerfile's apps stage: the Amethystora apps (apps/, a Cargo workspace), built with Fedora's Rust
# on the same base image they run on, so that they link against the GTK and libadwaita the image has. The
# tests run first: the shared crate's, which hold every date, number and list to what the Electron windows
# wrote, and every app's, Notes' among them reading and writing the Electron window's own files. Only the
# program and the licences of the crates built into it leave the stage, in /out (13-apps.sh installs them):
# the toolchain and the crates' sources stay here, and the build itself is cleared away once done. The
# stage's Node runs Notes' tests of the Electron side, and the checks written in JavaScript in 20-tests.sh.
#
# Cargo.lock pins every crate by version and checksum (--locked), and the crates come from crates.io, which
# serves them by that checksum.
