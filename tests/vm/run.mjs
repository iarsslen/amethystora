#!/usr/bin/env node
// A test run, in the lab container: builds the image from the commit tests/vm/run.sh sent, installs it onto a
// disk, boots it, and runs the suites in tests/vm/suites in it. Everything it did is in /vm/runs/<when>/
// (/vm/runs/last): run.log, one log per stage and per suite, a screenshot after each suite, the guest's
// journal, results.json, and summary.md, which it prints last.
//
//   node run.mjs [all | build | disk | test | plan] [--keep] [--image IMAGE] [--tag TAG] [--suites NN,NN...]
//                [--parallel N [--reuse]] [--memory MB]
//
// all (the default) does the three in turn and stops at the first that fails; the others do one, from what
// the last run left. --keep leaves the VMs running afterwards, for a closer look over MCP. The exit status is
// 0 only when everything that ran passed. VMLAB_NAME (default test) names the run's image tag, disks and VMs,
// so that two sessions' runs do not take each other's. --image builds amethystora-dx, or either with -nvidia-open or
// -nvidia-lts, instead of amethystora; --tag builds that stream (beta, which can be on the next Fedora) instead of
// latest; --suites runs only the suites with those numbers.
//
// --parallel N runs the suites in N VMs at once. VM NAME starts on the disk, runs the suites shards.json calls prep
// (the boot, the first-run setup, the sign-in), waits for the first boot's Flatpaks and powers itself off: that is
// the ready state, which VMs NAME-p1...NAME-pN start from (lab.mjs's vm_start from: an overlay on its overlay,
// nothing copied). The other suites are spread over the N lanes by their minutes in shards.json, longest first onto
// the lane with the least; a suite it does not name counts default_minutes. A lane runs its suites in name order,
// those that come last after the rest, then its installer suites on NAME-installer-pK, a fresh overlay of the
// installer disk; the screens suites are one unit, on NAME-screens, also from the ready state. plan prints the
// lanes and runs nothing. --memory gives every VM but the screens one that much memory (default 4096). --reuse
// starts from the ready state an earlier run made on the same disk, when there is one, instead of making it again.
//
// A suite is a bash script run as root in the guest, beside lib.sh: one "ok - ...", "not ok - ..." or
// "skip - ..." line per check, and exit status 0 only when it passed. Exit status 100 asks for a reboot:
// the suite runs again after it, with SUITE_PHASE one higher. A suite whose second line is
// "# vmlab-vm: installer" runs on a machine of its own installed as the installer lays a disk out, encrypted, and
// "# vmlab-vm: screens" on the first machine's disk with four screens. A suite that leaves its machine of no use to
// the suites after it (90 switches the image and starts over) says "# vmlab-order: last" in its first lines, and runs
// after every other suite of that machine; the others run in the order of their names.
// Exit status 101 runs the next phase in the same boot, for what takes longer than a phase may (30 minutes),
// and with /var/lib/vmlab-tests/usb.json left (usb_next in lib.sh) USB devices plugged in or out first.
// A phase that leaves /var/lib/vmlab-tests/next-boot.json gets a power cycle instead of a reboot, with what it
// asks for (next_boot in lib.sh): spare disks absent or faulty, other credentials, the passphrase typed; or
// with {"itself": true} no restart from here at all, only a wait for the one the phase left to happen, a soft
// reboot included, which keeps the boot id and counts in systemd's SoftRebootsCount.
