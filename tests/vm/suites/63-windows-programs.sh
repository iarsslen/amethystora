#
#   1. the types and their default, a program opened from Files, and what the handler says and offers for each kind:
#      signed, changed after signing, unsigned, a known program, Steam, one Wine cannot run, a driver, a part of
#      Windows, known malware, and the image's own app opened in place of one
#   2. an unknown program run with Bottles: X11 granted to Bottles alone, a first bottle made, and the file reaching
#      Bottles through the document portal
