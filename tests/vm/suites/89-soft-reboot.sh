# Finishing an update with a soft reboot (amethystora-soft-reboot: System Updates' Restart now, `ame update
# restart`), on the installer-layout machine, whose /boot keeps a staged deployment through a restart:
# - the initramfs the image was built with holds nothing that changes with every build: no build version in its
#   os-release, no out-of-tree driver, which the system still loads itself (19-initramfs.sh);
# - updates made here from the running system (a hardlink checkout of its commit, changed and committed back, as
#   ostree's own soft-reboot test makes them: a copy of the image would not fit) and staged: one that adds a file
#   and compresses a loaded driver anew, as akmods builds its drivers anew from the same source for every image, is
#   quick; the same with a kernel argument added and one with that driver changed are not, and say why, nor is one
#   while the firmware was asked to start something next (BootNext); nothing staged says none;
# - the status as the account through pkexec without a password, prepare and reset as the account in its
#   session, and an app inhibiting logging out leaving the restart to GNOME's dialog;
# - System Updates: Restart now says the restart takes seconds and asks first, and Restart ends the session with a
#   soft reboot: the same kernel (boot id), SoftRebootsCount one higher, the update running, a file put in /etc
#   after it was staged still there, the account signed in again;
# - a full restart afterwards starts the update too, and the machine is put back on its own image.
