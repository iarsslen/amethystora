# Drivers (plans/done/PLAN-driver-compatibility.md), on the machine installed as the installer lays a disk out,
# whose /boot keeps a staged deployment through a restart, since two of these change the kernel's arguments:
# - The driver check: its timer, the status it saves for everyone, nothing found on a machine whose devices all
#   have their driver, and a module the kernel refused found as one, from the kernel's own words.
# - FireWire's switch (ame security firewire): off lets the modules load and leaves the other blocked ones blocked,
#   on blocks them again; the report says it is off.
# - The rebase helper's Secure Boot guard: no switch to an NVIDIA image while the key its driver needs is not
#   enrolled (mokutil stood in for).
# - The Xbox wireless adapter (ame apps xbox-adapter): Microsoft's firmware downloaded and checked, the blacklist
#   and the firmware path, which the watcher accepts exactly; after a restart the kernel looks there first; off
#   takes all of it away again.
# - Waiting firmware updates said once by the update alert (fwupdmgr and notify-send stood in for), and the
#   report's firmware check.
