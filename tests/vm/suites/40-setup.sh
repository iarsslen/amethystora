# Your setup as a file (ame setup) on a machine as a person has it: GNOME's own settings, Flathub and Homebrew.
# What the account changes in its session is what `save` writes, and nothing left at the image's value; `diff`
# agrees with the file; `apply` lists what it adds, asks, does it, and finds nothing to do a second time;
# `--remove` asks again and, told no, takes nothing away; `--yes` needs no terminal; a file with an address or a
# command is refused before anything runs. A backup still stores the setup, and `ame restore-setup` reads it.
# An image of your own, the machine's side: `ame system trust-image` makes the machine take a repository's images
# only with its key's signature (bootc refuses one without), never for Amethystora's own, and
# amethystora-image-check passes here. The suites after this one get the machine back as it was.
