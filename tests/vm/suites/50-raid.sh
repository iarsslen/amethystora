# Pools of disks (ame system raid) on the five blank SATA disks the lab adds, SPARE-1 to SPARE-5 (8 GiB, the
# fifth 10 GiB), as plans/done/PLAN-raid.md's "Check on a machine" has them, over ten starts of the machine:
#   1. parity (raid5, not encrypted) on SPARE-3 to 5, the disks named; data on the two left with Enter, Enter,
#      Enter and ERASE (two copies, encrypted). Their lines, key, owner, and Files showing them.
#   2. Both back after a restart, data unlocked by its key with nothing asked; the recovery key; the status
#      without root, and its speed; no TPM unlock for a pool; Control's words; a scrub cut short, then
#      resumed; a disk of parity taken away while mounted, and what the hourly check makes of it.
#   3. The disk back; parity forgotten, its files left; joined (combined, encrypted) made on two of its disks.
#   4. joined back after the restart, then forgotten; data filled, and one of its disks made to vanish.
#   5. data did not open and the boot did not wait for it; opened with a disk missing, written to; a replace
#      refused while it is too full, one stopped part way; the disk replaced by SPARE-5, its copies put back.
#   6. data after the restart checked clean; SPARE-4 added, then pulled out while mounted (encrypted).
#   7. SPARE-4 back: back, not failing, its copies put back. A file's copy given bad sectors for the next start.
#   8. The damaged disk: the file reads right, the disk counts errors, the notification's Open Control clicked,
#      the disk replaced by SPARE-3 while it still reads. A copy overwritten behind btrfs's back repaired by a
#      scrub. A real suspend cuts a scrub short, which the next run resumes. A disk of data unplugged.
#   9. data did not open, and the boot did not wait; opened with the disk gone, written to; the disk plugged in.
#  10. It is back and its copies put back; data forgotten, leaving nothing behind.
# The script asks sudo for each step that needs root, so tester's sudo asks no password while this suite runs.
