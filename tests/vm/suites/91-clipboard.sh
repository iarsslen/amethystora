# Amethystora Clipboard (plans/PLAN-clipboard.md): the clipboard history sealed under a key in the login keyring.
# Copied to as apps copy (wl-copy, and clipcopy.py's own window), read back as the menu shows it (atspi.py) and as
# the disk holds it (opened with the keyring's key). Three phases:
#   1. At login no keyring, then one made and unlocked with the account's password, as a password login does:
#      Clipboard Indicator's plain history and a setting of it taken over; what is copied, pictures too, sealed
#      and nowhere in the clear; a password manager's copy and an excluded app's not recorded; the history
#      outlasts the screen lock and a burst of copies. Then a login with the keyring locked, as a fingerprint
#      leaves it, stood in for by locking it over D-Bus and enabling the extension again: earlier items held back,
#      a new copy in memory only, the menu's row and GNOME's prompt unlocking it and merging the two; and once
#      more, unlocked elsewhere, which the extension notices by itself. The keyring is left with no password, as
#      on a machine that signs in by itself (one with a password left the lab's GDM login behind its greeter),
#      and keep-history set to restart, as Control does.
#   2. After a restart: only the pinned item from before. keep-history set to always.
#   3. After another restart: everything kept, and nothing the extension threw in the three boots.
