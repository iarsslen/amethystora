# vmlab-vm: installer
# The system's own disks (ame system raid mirror DISK, plans/done/PLAN-raid.md's 2b), on the lab's second machine,
# installed as the installer lays a disk out: an ESP, an ext4 /boot and btrfs on LUKS, on its 40 GiB disk, with
# SPARE-1 and 2 (8 GiB) for an encrypted pool and SPARE-3 and 4 (48 GiB) larger than it. In steps, each in a phase
# of its own, a step that runs long going on in the next phase of the same boot:
#   setup       the account, the layout, the firmware's entry as Anaconda makes it, the offer in the status and
#               Control, an encrypted pool beside the encrypted system; then the mirror onto SPARE-3 started
#   mirroring   waited for: the system on both disks, /boot a RAID1 of one half, the restart from the new disk
#               set; the passphrase typed at the restart
#   finished    asked once for both disks; started from the new disk, the first disk's /boot joined, both ESPs
#               pointed at the mirror; the TPM enrolled on the system's two disks and not on the pool's
#   tpm         started by the TPM and its PIN alone; an update, whose new kernel both halves of /boot get
#   updated     both halves and both ESPs alike; then the first disk unplugged
#   first-dead  started from the second disk with "Start with a disk missing"; then the first disk back
#   first-back  the disk that came back has its copies put back, and counts nothing; then SPARE-3 unplugged
#   second-dead started degraded from the first disk; SPARE-4 in SPARE-3's place, its ESP, /boot half and key
#   replaced    started by the TPM from the first disk and SPARE-4; nothing of SPARE-3 left
