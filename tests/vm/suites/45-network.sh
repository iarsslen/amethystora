# The network switches on networks made here: a network namespace with dnsmasq (DHCPv4, DHCPv6, router
# advertisements, DNS for a search domain of its own) and a web server that answers every page with a login
# page, as a hotel's network does, and a second link standing for a VPN.
# - As the image ships: temporary IPv6 addresses, Wi-Fi's address per network name (Fedora's), and the
#   machine's name told to every network.
# - A different address on each network (ame security mac): a wired network sees an address of its own, the
#   same each time, another network another one, a default for one port in an earlier file does not win over
#   it (as Fedora's for Wi-Fi does not), no network is told the machine's name or its DHCPv6 identity, and
#   off gives everything back.
# - Encrypted DNS (ame security dns): every name over DNS-over-TLS to the resolver chosen and to nobody else,
#   the network's own names and the connectivity check still on the network's servers, a VPN's settings kept
#   through every change.
# - A network that wants a login first: NetworkManager says so with encrypted DNS on, the session is offered
#   the pause in a notification that keeps its button on the screen, `ame security dns pause` lets the login
#   page load, and the pause ends by its timer. (Pressing the button cannot be done here: GNOME Shell's
#   buttons offer no AT-SPI action. Pressed with the lab's mouse, vm_mouse, it opens the command in a terminal.)
# - Firefox looks names up through the system's resolver as Fedora builds it, and with its own DNS-over-HTTPS
#   turned on asks its provider instead, without either breaking the other.
