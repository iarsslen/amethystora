# vmlab-vm: r4-notify
# Round 4, group notify (plans/beyond/spec-r4-notify.md, its acceptance criteria), in the test account's session, asked
# of GNOME Shell itself through Eval, which a lab-only extension of the test account opens (never in the image):
#   - Later and mute: the banner's buttons after the app's own (none, two and three of them), Later in an hour with its
#     Undo and back with the same buttons, the calendar's groups, a mute holding the shown, the queued and the new
#     banners but the urgent, Unmute's card, When I next unlock through a real lock, the key off forgetting everything,
#     nothing written;
#   - What's new: the image's own file and page, the pill saying Updated once after a version seen before (what the
#     releases newer than it brought), its card's three rows, Read it all opening the Manual, the pill back to the clock
#     after the minute, never again, nothing for a new account or after a rollback;
#   - Getting set in the calendar menu, its lines ticked by what the machine says, Hide for good;
#   - Power you can see: the battery's menu with a stand-in UPower (upower-standin.py), the busy chip from a real busy
#     app scope over two minutes, its card, Not now, said once an hour, and a chip that goes once its card closes;
#   - ten disables and enables leaving nothing, Control's entries and the setup file.
# A software-rendered lab shell leaves a banner queued until it is told to look again (Main.messageTray._updateState()):
# the suite does that (poke) where a banner should show, which a real session does by itself at its next event.
