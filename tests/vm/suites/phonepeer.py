"""A stand-in phone for the suites: the phone link's protocol (plans/amethystora-connect/spec-protocol.md, protocol 8)
from the phone's side, as far as a test needs it, with nothing of any other program's code. It has a certificate of
its own, is paired with the program by its pin (the suite writes it into the account's list of paired phones before
the program starts), connects to the computer, and then does what the lines of a command file say, one at a time:

  phonepeer.py init DIR                  a key, a certificate and a device id in DIR; prints the device id
  phonepeer.py pin DIR                   the certificate as the list of paired phones keeps it (base64 of the DER)
  phonepeer.py run DIR HOST [PORT]       connects to HOST:PORT (1716) and serves DIR/commands, logging to DIR/log

Commands, one a line, appended to DIR/commands while it runs:

  packet TYPE JSON                       sends a packet of that type with that body
  share PATH                             shares a file, its payload served on a port of its own
  quit                                   closes the connection and ends
