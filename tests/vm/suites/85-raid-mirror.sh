# The system spread over two disks with one copy of each file, as the installer leaves it when two disks are
# chosen, mirrored (ame system raid mirror, plans/done/PLAN-raid.md's 2a), started with its second disk dead and
# given it back. On SPARE-6 (24 GiB, more than the system's data), which stays unplugged until this suite. In
# steps, each in a phase of its own, a step that runs long going on in the next phase of the same boot:
#   plug        SPARE-6 plugged in (a power cycle)
#   spread      the system over the lab disk and SPARE-6, as the installer spreads it; offered and mirrored
#   mirroring   waited for: two copies, the boot menu's Start with a disk missing; then SPARE-6 unplugged
#   degraded    started with it chosen; written to; SPARE-6 back
#   back        the copies put back, nothing counted; then the system on one disk again, as the suites after
#               this one expect it
#   single      the boot menu's entry gone with the second disk
# Before 90-control-switch.sh, which must stay the last suite.
