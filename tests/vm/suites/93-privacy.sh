# The trash emptied after 30 days (plans/done/PLAN-privacy-defaults.md): the image's default in a session, GNOME's
# housekeeping running, and `ame desktop privacy trash 7` taken by that running session at once. Three items in
# the trash, deleted 40 days, 10 days and a moment ago, put there before a restart as a month's trash would be,
# and the hourly purge of the next session waited for: the first two go, the third stays. What was deleted is
# still in a snapshot taken before, and a restic repository beside the trash is not touched. Then off, and Reset
# settings puts the image's default back.
# The purge runs an hour after gsd-housekeeping started and every hour after, so the wait outlasts a phase's 30
# minutes: each phase waits up to 20, then the next one goes on in the same boot (continue_phase). The hour is of
# time awake, and an idle session suspends after 15 minutes, so the session is kept from suspending meanwhile.
