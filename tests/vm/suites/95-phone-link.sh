# The phone link (plans/PLAN-amethystora-connect.md) on a machine with no phone: GSConnect is gone, the program is
# there and off, `ame desktop phone on` starts it and nothing else, it listens where the firewall lets phones in and
# where the security watcher expects it, and `off` takes every listener away again. A pairing needs a phone, which the
# lab has not: apps/connect/tests holds the interop test against Fedora's KDE Connect daemon.
