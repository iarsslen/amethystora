# Software from other distributions (amethystora-pkg), the NVIDIA check and "You're on the previous version"
# (plans/PLAN-vanilla-features.md, items 1 to 3), as a machine runs them. A phase each, for the time each takes:
#
#   1. a container made from the alpine template and used as the account would, the watcher's look at a fake
#      sudo and a stray launcher beside the launcher it exported, the daily upgrade and the report's check on it,
#      definitions imported, and a file that matches known malware refused
#   2. a .deb from a file: scanned, explained, asked about, then installed in a Debian container made for it
#   3. the NVIDIA check, here and on stand-in hardware; then everything amethystora-pkg made goes
#   4. a newer version of the image made the default while this one runs, as picking the second boot entry
#      leaves a machine, and "Keep this version"
