# The logo menu (plans/done/PLAN-logo-menu.md): Amethystora's own extension at the left end of the top bar, used as a
# person would, through GNOME Shell's accessibility tree and a pointer of the lab's own (keys.py). Two phases:
#   1. On, and nothing of the Logo Menu it replaced; leftmost in the top bar; its entries in order, each opening
#      its app; a middle click showing and hiding the overview and opening no menu; Mission Center taken away
#      hiding its entry and nothing installing it; back and leftmost after the screen lock. Then the account
#      given the list of extensions an account kept from before the swap, for the next login.
#   2. After a restart and that login: the new extension turned on by the image's own hook, and leftmost.
