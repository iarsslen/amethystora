# each launcher started as GNOME Shell starts it (activated on the session bus, or with gio when it is not), given
# a few seconds, then closed. None may crash, none may be refused what it
# needs (a Flatpak whose `flatpak-spawn --host` the image's global override denies says so on its output, as
# Mission Center's gatherer did), and opening them may make the security watcher say nothing: with the image's
# own settings, using the image's own apps is not news. Then a restart, after which a boot and a login make it
# say nothing either: loading its own audit rules, Fedora's sssd and tuned, and a program of the login once did.
# Amethystora's own apps are 20-apps.sh's.
