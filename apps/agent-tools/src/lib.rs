//! The AI agent's own tools on Amethystora: an MCP server over stdio, started by the agent as
//! `amethystora-agent-tools mcp` and living only while it does, and the same answers as a command. Level 1
//! knows: it searches a local index of the manual and the image's own reference, and reads the machine's
//! state and journal. Level 2 acts, and asks first every time. plans/PLAN-agentic-os.md says why.
