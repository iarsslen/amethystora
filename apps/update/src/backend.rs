//! What Amethystora Updates knows of the machine, and the update it follows: what main.js did for the
//! Electron window.
//!
//! "Update now" starts uupd-manual.service: uupd, the updater the automatic updates run from uupd.timer,
//! without the hardware checks that hold those back on a busy machine. It updates what `ame update` does,
//! the system image, the Flatpaks of the machine and of everyone signed in, and Homebrew, and the polkit
//! rule the uupd package ships lets it be started without a password. An update that is already running,
//! the automatic one included, is followed instead of being started a second time.
//!
//! What the window shows while it runs is uupd's own JSON log, read from the journal, which Fedora opens to
//! the members of wheel. For anyone else the window still knows from systemd whether an update is running
//! and how it ended.
//!
//! The containers amethystora-pkg manages are each account's own, and uupd's own module for containers
//! stays off (/etc/uupd/config.json). Once an update started here has finished, the window starts the
//! account's amethystora-pkg-upgrade.service, which upgrades them, and follows the line of JSON it logs for
//! each one. How that goes shows on the Containers step and nowhere else: a container that did not upgrade
//! never makes the system's update a failed one.
//!
//! An update that leaves the kernel, its initramfs and its arguments as they are is finished with a soft
//! reboot: only the system's programs start again, not the computer. amethystora-soft-reboot says when, has the
//! update mounted for it and asks logind for the restart, which logind then makes one. GNOME's own restart
//! dialog, which every other restart here goes through, cannot do that, so the window asks first itself, and
//! leaves the restart to GNOME's dialog when an app asks not to end the session, which only that dialog lets
//! it say.
//!
//! A machine started from an older version than the one it starts by default, which is what picking the
//! second entry in the boot menu does, is said so, with the choice of keeping that version, which
//! `bootc rollback` does after an administrator's password, or restarting into the newest.
//!
//! Firmware is not uupd's: the window asks fwupd which devices have an update on LVFS, which needs no
//! password, and installing one is `fwupdmgr update`, in a terminal, where fwupd says what it is about to
//! do and asks before it restarts the machine. fwupd-refresh.timer fetches what LVFS has every day.
