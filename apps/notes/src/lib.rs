//! Amethystora Notes: notes and tasks, kept on this computer and nowhere else, in place of Joplin and
//! Planify. Notes are Markdown in notebooks, with tags, attachments, a history and a trash; tasks sit in the
//! inbox or in projects and their sections, with dates, repeats, reminders, priorities, labels and subtasks.
//! Nothing is synced, and nothing here opens a connection.
//!
//! backend.rs is what main.js was, and keeps the same files in the same formats (vault.rs seals them), so
//! that notes move between this window and the Electron one unchanged; import.rs, export.rs and
//! passkeys.rs are the rest of main.js, session.rs its notifications and powerMonitor. page/ is notes.js.
