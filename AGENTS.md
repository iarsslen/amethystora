# Amethystora Copilot Instructions

This document provides essential information for coding agents working with the Amethystora repository to minimize exploration time and avoid common build failures.

## Repository Overview

**Amethystora** is a cloud-native desktop operating system, based on Universal Blue and maintained by Arsslen Idadi (@iarsslen). It is an OS built on Fedora Linux using container technologies with atomic updates.

- **Type**: Container-based Linux distribution build system
- **Base**: `ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main` (Fedora with the GNOME desktop and GDM) + Universal Blue infrastructure; GNOME Shell extensions are git submodules under `system_files/shared/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions`, built by `build_files/shared/build-gnome-extensions.sh`, except `amethystora-transitions@iarsslen.github.io` (see The transitions) and `amethystora-widgets@iarsslen.github.io` (see Widgets)
- **Languages**: Bash scripts, JSON configuration, Python utilities
- **Build System**: Just (command runner), Podman/Docker containers, GitHub Actions
- **Target**: desktop OS with two variants (base + developer experience)

## Repository Structure

### Root Directory Files
- `Containerfile` - Main container build definition (stages: `ctx`, `brew`, `fprintd`, `base`)
- `Containerfile.sealed` - The sealed variant of a built image (`just seal`; see Sealed images)
- `secure-boot.crt` - The certificate of the Secure Boot key sealed images are signed with, once `just secure-boot-key` has made it
- `Justfile` - Build automation recipes (like a Makefile but more readable)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks for basic validation
- `image-versions.yml` - Image version configurations
- `cosign.pub` - Container signing public key
- `keys/` - Upstream's public keys, kept here rather than fetched from a branch that can move: Universal Blue's cosign key (`ublue-os-cosign.pub`, which `just verify-container` checks the base, akmods and brew images with) and the two akmods certificates `just secureboot` checks the kernel against
- `SECURITY.md` - How to report a vulnerability (privately, through the repository's Security tab)

### Key Directories
- `system_files/` - Files copied into the image, overlaid on those of the upstream layers
  - `shared/` - Every image: configurations, fonts, themes, the manual, the `ame` commands
  - `dx/` - `amethystora-dx` only, copied in by `build_files/shared/build-dx.sh`
  - `sealed/` - the sealed images only, copied in by `build_files/sealed/00-sealed.sh`
- `apps/` - The Amethystora apps (Manual, Security, Updates, Notes, Logs, Backups, Control): one Rust
  program, a Cargo workspace built in the Containerfile's `apps` stage (see The Amethystora apps); the same
  workspace builds `amethystora-sensor` and the AI agent's tools (`agent-tools`, see Agentic features)
- `build_files/` - Build scripts organized as base/, dx/, shared/
  - `base/` - Base image build scripts (00-image-info.sh through 20-tests.sh)
  - `dx/` - Developer experience build scripts
  - `sealed/` - The sealing stage of `Containerfile.sealed`: prepare, build the UKI, test
  - `shared/` - Common build utilities and helper scripts
- `branding/` - Source of the artwork; `node branding/generate.mjs` draws it
- `iso/` - `iso.toml`, the bootc-image-builder configuration of the installer ISO; `product/`, which `build-iso.yml` adds to the ISO as `images/product.img`: the installer's Amethystora look (a stylesheet and artwork drawn by `branding/generate.mjs`), crash reporting (libreport files that send crash reports to Amethystora's issue tracker instead of Fedora's Bugzilla) and the Anaconda profile that keeps Fedora's installer settings although the installer's os-release says `generic`; `installer-packages.py`, which lists what the installer is made of; and `live/`, the live system of the live ISO: a `Containerfile` built `FROM` the published image with `build.sh`, which adds Fedora's live boot, live session and Anaconda's web installer, a copy of the image for an offline install (`installer.ks`), a profile for the image's own os-release ID, and the boot menu Titanoboa reads (`iso.yaml`)
- `packaging/` - Packages Amethystora rebuilds, each in its folder with a README: `fprintd/` is Fedora's fprintd with the duress finger's patches, built in the Containerfile's `fprintd` stage on every image build. Renovate looks for a new fprintd release every Monday. The `.patch` files are kept byte for byte (`.gitattributes`, and the pre-commit whitespace hooks skip them)
- `po/` - The gettext catalogs of the shell programs that are translated, the security report and the app permissions (text domain `amethystora`): `amethystora.pot`, which `node build_files/shared/check-translations.js --write --po po system_files/shared` writes from the scripts, and one `<language>.po` each, which `14-security.sh` compiles into `/usr/share/locale`
- `tests/vm/` - The VM lab: a privileged container with QEMU, KVM, Secure Boot firmware, a TPM and the build's
  tools. `run.sh` builds the last commit, installs it onto a disk, boots it and runs `suites/` in it; an MCP
  server (`server.mjs`) drives a VM by hand (`README.md`). Its helper reaches the guest as a systemd credential
  at boot: never put any of it in the image. A new feature gets its check in `suites/` with it. "Run the
  tests" means the `run-tests` skill (`.claude/skills/run-tests`), and only when asked
- `.github/workflows/` - Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines

The desktop layer (the `ujust` recipes, the Homebrew Brewfiles, the setup services and hooks, the
GNOME defaults, udev rules) is kept in `system_files/shared`, already renamed, and is not pulled
from upstream. Only `ublue-os/brew`, for
Homebrew's own setup, is still copied in by the `ctx` stage of the `Containerfile`. Where to edit:
- `system_files/shared/usr/share/amethystora/just/` - the commands `/usr/bin/ame` runs, as just recipes in groups (`ame security scan now`). `00-entry.just` declares each group with `mod` (`agent`, `apps`, `desktop`, `security`, `system`, each in the file of its name), imports the top-level commands (`backup.just`, `changelog.just`, `control.just`, `report.just`, `update.just`), and runs `amethystora-pkg` as `ame pkg`. A command that switches something takes `on|off` (or the value it sets) as an argument, so that Control and scripts can say what they want; without one it may ask or flip, as before. `ujust` is the same command, and the flat names the recipes had under it are private aliases there: when a command is renamed or moved, alias its old name. `20-tests.sh` fails on an `ame` command that the image names and that does not exist, so in prose write `ame` in backticks or with punctuation after it
- `system_files/shared/usr/share/flatpak/preinstall.d/` - the Flatpaks every machine comes with, which `flatpak-preinstall.service` installs on the first boot that has a network (the ISO carries none) and retries until it does: `amethystora.preinstall` is the default list (no browser, Firefox is in the image; Amethystora Logs in place of GNOME Logs), and `system_files/dx` adds `amethystora-dx.preinstall`. Every group needs its `Branch` (`stable`, `3.22` for a GTK 3 theme), and taking an app off a list uninstalls it from the machines that got it from there
- `system_files/shared/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/zz0-amethystora-modifications.gschema.override` - the base GNOME defaults (the dash, the custom keybinding list); `build-gnome-extensions.sh` adds each extension it installs to its `enabled-extensions`, and `zz1-amethystora-modifications` overrides it

### Architecture
- **Two Build Targets**: `base` (regular users) and `dx` (developer experience)
- **Image Flavors**: main, nvidia-open, nvidia-lts (see Drivers)
- **Fedora Versions**: resolved per build by `just fedora_version` (see Version Detection); `04-packages.sh` has cases for 42, 43 and 44
- **Stream Tags**: `stable`, `latest`, `beta`
- **Build Process**: Sequential shell scripts in build_files/ directory
- **Base Images**: Uses `ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main` as foundation from Universal Blue

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
**ALWAYS install these tools before attempting any builds:**

```bash
# Install Just command runner (REQUIRED for build commands, may not be available)
# If external access is limited, Just commands will not work
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Verify container runtime (usually available)
podman --version || docker --version

# Install pre-commit for validation (usually works)
pip install pre-commit
```

**Note**: In restricted environments, Just command runner may not be installable. Most validation can still be done with pre-commit and manual JSON validation.

### Essential Commands

**Build validation (ALWAYS run before making changes):**
```bash
# 1. Validate syntax and formatting (2-3 minutes)
# Note: .devcontainer.json will fail JSON check due to comments - this is expected
pre-commit run --all-files

# 2. Check Just syntax (requires Just installation)
just check  # Only if Just command runner is available

# 3. Fix formatting issues automatically
just fix    # Only if Just command runner is available
```

**Build commands (use with extreme caution - these take 30+ minutes and require significant resources):**
```bash
# Build base image (30-60 minutes, requires 20GB+ disk space)
just build amethystora latest main

# Build developer variant (45-90 minutes, requires 25GB+ disk space)
just build amethystora-dx latest main

# Build with specific kernel pin
just build amethystora latest main "" "" "" "6.10.10-200.fc40.x86_64"
```

**Utility commands:**
```bash
# Clean build artifacts (if Just available)
just clean

# List all available recipes (if Just available)
just --list

# Validate image/tag/flavor combinations (if Just available)
just validate amethystora latest main
```

**Working without Just (when external access is restricted):**
```bash
# Manual validation instead of 'just check':
find . -name "*.just" -exec echo "Checking {}" \; -exec head -5 {} \;

# Manual cleanup instead of 'just clean':
rm -rf *_build* previous.manifest.json changelog.md output.env

# View Justfile recipes manually:
grep -n "^[a-zA-Z].*:" Justfile | head -20
```

### Critical Build Notes

1. **Container builds require massive resources** (20GB+ disk, 8GB+ RAM, 30+ minute runtime)
2. **Always run `just check` before making changes** - catches syntax errors early
3. **Pre-commit hooks are mandatory** - run `pre-commit run --all-files` to validate changes
4. **Never run full builds in CI unless specifically testing container changes**
5. **Use `just clean` to reset build state if encountering issues**

### Common Build Failures & Workarounds

**Pre-commit failures:**
```bash
# Known issue: .devcontainer.json contains comments (invalid for JSON checker)
# This failure is expected and can be ignored:
# ".devcontainer.json: Failed to json decode"

# Fix end-of-file and trailing whitespace automatically
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Just syntax errors (if Just is available):**
```bash
# Auto-fix formatting
just fix

# Manual validation
just check
```

**Container build failures:**
- Ensure adequate disk space (25GB+ free)
- Clean previous builds: `just clean` (if available)
- Check container runtime: `podman system info` or `docker system info`
- Build failures often indicate resource constraints rather than code issues

## Validation Pipeline

### Pre-commit Hooks (REQUIRED)
The repository uses mandatory pre-commit validation:
- `check-json` - Validates JSON syntax
- `check-toml` - Validates TOML syntax
- `check-yaml` - Validates YAML syntax
- `end-of-file-fixer` - Ensures files end with newline
- `trailing-whitespace` - Removes trailing whitespace

**Always run:** `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing changes.

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `build-image-latest-main.yml` - Builds latest images on main branch changes
- `build-image-stable.yml` - Builds stable release images
- `build-image-beta.yml` - Builds beta images
- `build-images.yml` - Runs the stable, latest and beta builds together (manual dispatch only)
- `reusable-build.yml` - Core build logic for all image variants, and on the stable stream the sealed images (see Sealed images)
- `generate-release.yml` - Generates release artifacts and changelogs
- `build-iso.yml` - Builds the installer ISO of a stable image, `<image>-non-uefi.iso` (the only one that starts computers without UEFI), with bootc-image-builder and uploads it, with its checksum signed by cosign, to Cloudflare R2 (a Release asset is limited to 2 GiB). Both of its ISOs are built from one digest of the published image, resolved and checked against `cosign.pub` once (the `image` job), so that the image cannot change between the check and either build. The builders run privileged and hold no secret: each hands its ISO, as an artifact, to the `publish` job on a runner of its own, which works out the checksum again, signs and uploads, and only on main. `Stable Images` runs it after scheduled and dispatched builds for each of the four images, each upload replacing the last under the same name, and the workflow fails on any other image. bootc-image-builder picks the installer's packages by os-release `ID` and has no definition for `amethystora`, so the workflow runs its container by hand and writes Fedora's definition out under that name, with `generic-logos` and `generic-release` added so that the installer carries neither `fedora-logos` nor `fedora-release`; do not switch back to its GitHub action, which cannot. `iso/installer-packages.py` then lists the installer's packages from the builder's manifest for the ISO to carry beside `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`, and fails the workflow before the upload if one of Fedora's two is among them. Both kickstarts (`iso/iso.toml`, `iso/live/installer.ks`) switch the installed machine with `--enforce-container-sigpolicy`, which only rewrites the origin and needs no network, and both ISO builds fail on a switch without it. Their `%post` runs under `set -e`, since Anaconda goes by its last exit status only, and on an NVIDIA image with Secure Boot on queues the image's certificates for the MOK manager (password `amethystora`), since the kernel refuses NVIDIA's driver until its key is enrolled and the image's kernel arguments turn off the display driver that would stand in. The builder is pinned by digest to its last build that reads definitions from a folder; its successor compiles them in, so moving to it means rewriting that step. Its second job, `live-iso`, builds the live ISO of the image, `<image>.iso` (`amethystora.iso` is https://download.amethystora.org/amethystora.iso): it builds `iso/live` `FROM` the checked digest with `podman build --cap-add sys_admin` (`iso/live/build.sh` pulls the offline copy by the same digest), and has Titanoboa (`ublue-os/titanoboa`, Apache-2.0, pinned to a commit of its main branch from the first that takes only an image) squash it into a UEFI-only ISO, then lists the live system's packages, fails on Fedora's logo or release package, adds `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and the list, and hands it to `publish` as the installer job does. Titanoboa's offline-install store in `/usr/lib/containers/storage` does not work with Fedora 45's podman 6 (ublue-os/titanoboa#151): solve that before the stable image moves to 45
- `bump-base-images.yml` - Daily on main: resolves every tag in `image-versions.yml` to its digest, checks each against `keys/ublue-os-cosign.pub`, and proposes the changed digests in one pull request from `automation/base-images`. Its pull requests start their checks only with a `BASE_BUMP_TOKEN` secret (a token with Contents and Pull requests write on this repository); `20-tests.sh` warns when the base is more than 10 days older than the build
- `security-rebuild.yml` - Daily on main, read-only but for the dispatch: compares the published stable image's source packages (its SBOM) with Fedora's security updates in Bodhi, and starts `Stable Images` when one was pushed after the published image's base was built and before the pinned base was. The kernel is left to the weekly build. Images carry `org.amethystora.base-created` for it
- `validate-renovate.yml` - Validates the Renovate configuration on pull requests
- `scorecard.yml` - OpenSSF Scorecard supply-chain checks (weekly)
- `clean.yml` - Cleanup old images and artifacts
- `moderator.yml` - Repository moderation tasks

**Workflow Architecture:**

- Stream-specific workflows (stable, latest, beta) call `reusable-build.yml`
- `reusable-build.yml` builds both base and dx variants for all flavors (main, nvidia-open, nvidia-lts)
- Fedora version is dynamically detected based on stream tag
- Images are signed with cosign and pushed to GHCR, and every tag pushed is checked against `cosign.pub` afterwards
- Only main publishes: one `PUBLISH` condition in `reusable-build.yml` (main's schedule and dispatches, the merge queue in front of main, and the `beta` branch's own stream) decides every push, signature, attestation and SBOM, and which builds get the real module and Secure Boot keys. Everything else builds with throwaway keys and publishes nothing. No build step gets `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and keys reach the build as files (`AKMODS_PRIVKEY_FILE`, `SECUREBOOT_KEY_FILE`), never on a command line
- cosign is installed from its pinned installer before the build, into `/usr/local/bin` for sudo, and `just verify-container` fails without it; just comes from a pinned release with its checksum (`.github/actions/install-just`)
- Every workflow sets `permissions: {}` or read-only access at the top and grants write access on the job that needs it, which OpenSSF Scorecard checks (`build-images.yml` is the exception: each job it runs needs the same write access)

### Manual Validation Steps
1. `pre-commit run --all-files` - Runs validation hooks (2-3 minutes, .devcontainer.json failure is expected)
2. `just check` - Validates Just syntax (if Just is available, 30 seconds)
3. `just fix` - Auto-fixes formatting issues (if Just is available, 30 seconds)
4. Test builds only if making container-related changes (30+ minutes)

## Package Management

### Package Configuration
Packages are defined directly in build scripts rather than in a central configuration file:
- `build_files/base/04-packages.sh` - Core package installations
  - `FEDORA_PACKAGES` array - Packages from official Fedora repos (installed in bulk)
  - `COPR_PACKAGES` array - Packages from COPR repos (installed individually with isolated enablement)
  - Fedora version-specific package sections using case statements (e.g., `42)`, `43)`)
- `build_files/dx/00-dx.sh` - Developer experience package additions. The editor is VSCodium, from its repository with the key pinned in `system_files/dx/etc/pki/rpm-gpg`: Microsoft's VS Code licence does not allow it to be shared inside a published image, so do not bring it back. `user-setup.hooks.d/10-vscodium.sh` installs only Open VSX extensions their makers published there, not copies its bot republished. Nothing joins an account to `docker`, `incus-admin` or `libvirt`, each root under another name: `ame system dx-group` offers the groups listed in `system_files/shared/usr/share/amethystora/developer-groups`, which Control and the security report read too

### Games, Android apps, drawing tablets and the CPU scheduler

Each is installed and off, and turned on per machine or per account by one command that says first what
it changes. `ame apps gaming` installs Steam, ProtonPlus and the MangoHud and gamescope Vulkan layers of
Steam's own runtime branch from Flathub, and grants X11 back to Steam alone, for the account
(`flatpak override --user`), and gives `/dev/uinput` back for Steam Input (`ame security virtual-input off`;
the image keeps it root's, Solaar's rule included, since a virtual keyboard types into any window, and
`ame apps opentabletdriver` does the same); Steam itself never goes into the image (its package is RPM Fusion's
non-free one). `gamemode` is in the image for games to reach through its portal. `ame apps android`
sets up Waydroid (Fedora's package, with its own SELinux policy; binder is built into Fedora's kernel):
it enables `waydroid-container.service`, which ships disabled, and downloads LineageOS without Google's
apps on the machine; never offer Google's. `ame system scheduler` picks a sched-ext scheduler through
`scx_loader.service` (shipped disabled, configured in `/etc/scx_loader/config.toml`) from CachyOS's
COPR `bieszczaders/kernel-cachyos-addons`, which Bazzite uses too: Fedora's own scx packages predate the
kernel interface. It checks `/sys/kernel/sched_ext` and falls back to the kernel's scheduler when the
kernel will not load one. `ame apps opentabletdriver` installs OpenTabletDriver from Flathub and copies
the udev rules of its release into `/etc`: the tag and the SHA-256 of the tarball are pinned in
`apps.just`, where Renovate's `github-release-attachments` manager bumps both, so nothing reaches `/etc`
from an unchecked download. Its daemon runs from the image's own user unit,
`amethystora-opentabletdriver.service`, which nothing enables for every account.

### Drivers

`plans/done/PLAN-driver-compatibility.md`. The rest of Universal Blue's common kmods come from the
`akmods` tarball `03-install-kernel-akmods.sh` already downloads, built for the image's kernel and signed
with Universal Blue's key, which `ame security secure-boot` enrolls; `20-tests.sh` fails on a module under
`extra` (evdi aside) signed with a certificate the image does not ship.
- **NVIDIA.** `-nvidia-open` carries NVIDIA's open driver (Turing and newer, PCI device ID 0x1E00 and up),
  `-nvidia-lts` its closed driver of the 580 branch (`akmods-nvidia-lts`; Maxwell, Pascal and Volta, 0x1340
  to 0x1DFF), the last NVIDIA makes for them, so that flavor has an end date; nothing NVIDIA makes drives older
  cards. Both bounds live in `amethystora-gpu-check` alone (`offer` prints its choice, which the driver
  check and the live ISO's sealed installer ask). `image-info.json`'s `image-flavor` is the flavor that ends
  the image's name. `amethystora-rollback-helper` refuses an NVIDIA image while Secure Boot is on and
  `akmods-amethystora.der` is not enrolled, which would start to a black screen. The `-nvidia-lts` images have
  no ISO; their GPL user space comes from negativo17's `nvidia-580`, which `source-manifest.sh` knows.
- **Xbox controllers.** xpadneo (Bluetooth) and xone (Microsoft's wireless adapter; wired pads are the
  kernel's `xpad`). `xone-kmod-common` carries Microsoft's adapter firmware, which no licence lets the
  image pass on, under names the driver no longer asks for: the build deletes it and moves its `blacklist
  mt76x2u` (which takes Wi-Fi from MT7612U sticks) to `/usr/share/amethystora/xone`, and
  `source-manifest.sh` never fetches its source package (`NOT_FETCHED`). `ame apps xbox-adapter on`
  downloads Microsoft's four driver packages, checks them and their firmware against
  `/usr/share/amethystora/xone/firmware` (static since 2017, so Renovate does not follow them), installs
  `xone_dongle_<ID>.bin` into `/var/lib/amethystora/firmware` (tmpfiles, root's), copies the blacklist and
  appends `firmware_class.path` with `rpm-ostree kargs`, never in `kargs.d`; sealed images refuse it. The
  kernel reads that folder before the image's firmware, so the watcher's drift check takes no file there but
  the pinned ones and no other firmware path.
- **Left out:** Broadcom's `wl` (its licence makes whoever passes it on indemnify Broadcom, and its
  CVE-2019-9501 and 9502 can never be fixed) and openrazer (its daemon is Terra's). `20-tests.sh` fails on
  either package, or on a blacklist of the kernel's own Broadcom drivers.
- **The driver check** (`amethystora-driver-status`, `amethystora-driver-check.timer` as root) saves
  `/var/lib/amethystora/drivers/status.json` for `ame system drivers`, `ame report` and the doctor, and says each
  finding once (`said` beside it): a PCI device of a kind a person notices with no driver, firmware asked for
  by a device left without one, a refused module, NVIDIA's driver not loaded, a Broadcom Wi-Fi card, the
  adapter without its firmware.
- **FireWire** is a switch of its own (`ame security firewire`), its modules in
  `usr/lib/modprobe.d/61-amethystora-firewire.conf`, apart from the blocked modules.
- **Lockdown** stays as the gaps plan left it (the maintainer's choice of 2026-10-07, over this plan's of
  2026-10-04): the argument on every image but the NVIDIA ones, and `ame security lockdown`.
- Kernel modules' source packages are `kmod-NAME`, built by Universal Blue from the akmod their makers publish
  as `NAME-kmod`: `source-manifest.sh` fetches that one and links the kmod's name to it.

### The browser

The browser is Firefox, Fedora's package, installed by `04-packages.sh` so that a machine has one
before it is online. Mozilla lets Firefox be redistributed only unaltered, so it ships exactly as
Fedora builds it: do not add a `policies.json`, an extension, a preference file or a home page for
it, in the image or from a setup hook (`20-tests.sh` fails on a policy file). That is why the image
has no browser policy and installs no extension. The one thing taken out, by the maintainer's choice
of 2026-10-04, is Fedora's start page: `04-packages.sh` deletes the two lines of Fedora's preferences
that open Firefox on start.fedoraproject.org and pin it on the new tab page, which leaves Firefox's
own home page. Never put amethystora.org or any other page there: Mozilla's distribution policy
names a changed home page among the changes that need its written consent. Brave, the browser before it, is not in the image
and not on the Flatpak lists: its terms license its package for personal use, not for
redistribution. Like every other browser, it is the user's to install from Bazaar.

Browser protection, the extension allowlist and the block on WebUSB, WebSerial, WebHID and Web
Bluetooth, is opt-in for the same reason: a policy the machine's owner turns on is theirs, not the
image's. `ame security browser` runs `/usr/libexec/amethystora-browser-policy`, which
writes `usr/share/amethystora/browser-policy/chromium.json` or `firefox.json`, with the IDs in
`/etc/amethystora/browser-extensions` added, to every place in its `TARGETS` table: Brave, Chrome,
Chromium, Edge and Firefox, as packages and as Flatpaks. To cover another browser, add its line
there. Keep the Firefox forks out: a system policy replaces the one they ship. The policies only
allow extensions and must never install one. The Security report reads the helper's `status`. Site
checking (`ame security browser osprey`, `OSPREY` in `security.conf`) adds Osprey's three IDs to the
allowlists while chosen, after its explanation: it sends every site's address to Osprey Project LLC, so it
is offered only, in no profile, never in the built-in list and never installed, and Osprey's own settings
are left to the user.

### Agentic features

Every image, base and dx, ships `amethystora-agent`, the launcher behind `Super+Ctrl+Shift+A` and
the menu's "Ask an agent". The agents it offers, Claude Code, Opencode, Codex, Antigravity CLI (`agy`),
Copilot CLI and Cursor CLI (`AGENTS` in the launcher, which `amethystora-agent list` prints for Control), are
deliberately not in the image: they release far more often than it does, so the launcher installs the
chosen one into the user's home with its maker's installer on first launch (or `ame agent install`),
where it updates on the user's terms. Antigravity CLI replaced Gemini CLI, which came from Homebrew: a
Gemini CLI already chosen and installed still opens, and the security readers still know it. Do not add them to `04-packages.sh`; `20-tests.sh` fails if
one appears in `/usr/bin`. The
skill in `system_files/shared/usr/share/amethystora/agents/skills/amethystora/SKILL.md` tells
agents how to change *a user's machine* safely: this repository is where it is written, not a place
it applies to. `amethystora-diagnose/SKILL.md` beside it is the read-only method behind
`amethystora-agent diagnose`. `user-setup.hooks.d/13-agentic.sh` links every skill there into
`~/.claude/skills`, which Claude Code reads, `~/.agents/skills`, which the others read, and
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills`, Antigravity CLI's own. Opencode reads
both and requires skill names to be unique across them, so the launcher starts it with
`OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILLS=1`. The features are **off by default** (the maintainer's choice of
2026-10-18): `ame agent toggle on` turns them on per user by writing `~/.config/amethystora/agentic`, and
the image ships no account with it. The update that made them so left every account off;
`user-setup.hooks.d/13-agentic-off.sh`, which runs before `13-agentic.sh` unlinks the skills it looks for,
takes away the old `no-agentic` marker and tells an account that had them on, once. Keep the skill
accurate when you change a command, path or recipe that it names. The main skill is a short core (under
7 KB, `20-tests.sh`) and `references/<topic>.md` files it names, read only when needed.

**Two levels, and the tools** (`plans/done/PLAN-agentic-os.md`). Level 1, "Agentic features", is the agent, its
skills and Amethystora's own read-only tools; level 2, "Let the agent make changes" (`ame agent tools on`,
the marker `~/.config/amethystora/agent-tools`, which needs level 1), adds the tools that change things.
The tools are one Rust program, `apps/agent-tools` (`/usr/libexec/amethystora-agent-tools`, no GTK): an MCP
server over stdio written by hand, which the agent starts and which lives only while it does, and the same
answers as a command (`amethystora-agent search|read|state|history`). Level 1 is `search` and `read` (the
index), `state` (thirteen topics, each a projection of the helper that already answers it, never state worked
out on its own), `logs` (every value given to journalctl as its own option) and `history`, pre-allowed in
the agents. Level 2 is `change` (a Control entry, through `apps/control-core`, the GTK-free crate Control
uses too), `software` (Flatpak, Homebrew, amepkg; never layering), `run` (a command handed to the user, in a
terminal or as root) and `undo`, each asked for every time; every change is recorded in
`~/.local/state/amethystora/agent-tools/actions.jsonl` with its way back. Text written by others reaches the
agent cleaned and marked as data. Off costs nothing: no daemon, timer or service.
- **The launcher gives each agent the tools at launch** and writes nothing into its settings: Claude Code
  `--mcp-config` and `--allowedTools`, Copilot CLI `--additional-mcp-config` and `--allow-tool`, Codex `-c
  mcp_servers.amethystora...` with each read tool's `approval_mode`, Opencode `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`. Cursor
  CLI and Antigravity CLI take no such option, so while the features are on their settings hold exactly
  one entry (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, and the read tools' allow rules),
  which the security reader accepts and nothing more under that name. `amethystora-agent argv AGENT` prints
  a launch, and `20-tests.sh` holds every option to `agent-cli-flags`. Check a new option with the installed
  agent's `--help` first, as these were on 2026-10-19.
- **The never list** (`apps/agent-tools/src/never.rs`) is refused by the tools and again by the root helper:
  the duress feature, a security command that loosens protection or sends something away (only reads and
  turning protection on pass), deleting from a backup or a snapshot, erasing disks, the AUR, sudoers, polkit,
  PAM, the agent's own lock and root mode, the Notes data, and shells or wrappers that would run commands out
  of sight. The tools that change things refuse while the agent runs with its own checks off (a flag from
  `agent-cli-flags` on the agent above the server, or a setting the security reader reports).
- **`/etc/amethystora/agent.conf`** is the administrator's: `ALLOW=act|know|off` (the most any account may
  turn on), `ALLOW_FOR=account:level` (one account's own), `ROOT=session|minutes|each|terminal`. Its one
  reader and writer is the tools program (`policy`, and `conf` as root, behind `ame agent lock` and `ame
  agent root`); a value it cannot read counts as the strictest. The watcher's drift check accepts it.
- **Root commands** run through `/usr/libexec/amethystora-agent-root`, which pkexec starts from the tool
  server with a socket pair on its stdin and stdout (a pipe could be opened by another process of the
  account through `/proc/PID/fd`), one polkit action per mode in `org.amethystora.agent.policy` (picked by
  `exec.argv1`), no rule letting anyone through. It reads agent.conf itself, runs only for the tool server of
  an account allowed to act, `env -i`, ten minutes at most, and says every command in a notification and the
  journal (`amethystora-agent-root`). In `session` it serves until the agent ends, the screen locks, an hour
  passes or agent.conf changes. `amethystora-in-terminal --agent --report` is the hand-off to a terminal.
- **Control's AI agent page** shows the root mode and the lock, each an `ame agent` command in a terminal:
  the maintainer's exception of 2026-10-18 to Security keeping every security setting, since they govern
  the agent, not a security feature.

**The knowledge and the index.** `system_files/shared/usr/share/amethystora/agents/knowledge` is written for
agents: `architecture.md`, `by-design.md` (each default the image hardens, its symptom, how to confirm it and
its switch), `desktop.md`, `agent.md`, `playbooks/<symptom>.md` (Symptom, Look, Causes on Amethystora, Fix,
Verify, Undo; `amethystora-doctor` findings name them) and `aliases.tsv`. **Keep it accurate** like the manual
and the skill: `20-tests.sh` fails on a `/usr` path, unit or `ame` command it names that the image lacks, and
nothing in it may name the duress feature. `build_files/shared/build-agent-index.sh` writes the index when
the image is built: the manual, the skills, the knowledge and a reference generated from the image itself
(every `ame` command from just's dump, helper header, unit, security switch and Control entry), cut into
passages of about 300 tokens whose ids are the manual's links, ranked by BM25F and by meaning with
potion-base-8M (Model2Vec, MIT), whose tokenizer and safetensors reader are in the crate and are held to the
model's own output (`tests/model-reference.jsonl`). `apps/agent-tools/tests/golden.tsv` is asked of the
source tree's index by cargo and of the image's by `20-tests.sh`, at recall@3 of at least 0.9: add a question
when you add a page an agent should find. `/usr/libexec/amethystora-doctor` (`ame system doctor`, `state
health`) is the read-only health check outside security, about ten seconds, no password.

Updates, Security and Logs offer **Ask the agent** where something failed, while the features are on
(`amethystora-agent status`): each runs `amethystora-agent diagnose` with what the program picked
itself, never words shown in its window. Updates passes the failed updater unit (one of its two), Security the
check's id looked up in the report it read (and passes that check's title and sentence), Logs a crash's
process number or the `.service` an entry came from, both checked for their shape.

### The Amethystora apps

The Manual, Security, Updates, Notes, Logs, Backups and Control are one program, written in Rust with
GTK 4 and libadwaita: the Cargo workspace in `apps/`, one crate for each app beside `common` (the
crate `amethystora-ui`, which they share) and `launcher`, which picks the app by the name it was started
as. The Containerfile's `apps` stage builds it on the same pinned base with Fedora's Rust
(`build_files/shared/build-apps.sh`), once every crate's tests pass, and `13-apps.sh` hard-links it to
each app's own path, `/usr/lib/amethystora-<app>/amethystora-<app>`, which the `/usr/bin` launchers
start. They were Electron windows of some 300 MB each until October 2026, and look as those did: keep
the look when you change one.

- `common` holds what the windows share: the frame (sidebar and window controls), the palette, which
  follows `~/.config/amethystora/current` as the theme changes, the wordmark (drawn live in Quicksand,
  from `apps/common/assets/gem.svg` and `gem-stem.svg`, which `branding/generate.mjs` writes), the
  icons, Markdown (`markdown.rs`, raw HTML shown as text), translations and running programs
  (`process.rs`), always as an argument vector, never through a shell. Each app's stylesheet is beside
  its code; the desktop's own `gtk.css` is kept out of the windows.
- A window's app id is `org.amethystora.<App>`, which its launcher's `StartupWMClass` names, so that GNOME
  finds the launcher's name and icon for it.
- An app keeps how it was left in `~/.local/state/amethystora/<app>.json`.
  `user-setup.hooks.d/20-retire-electron-profiles.sh` takes away the Chromium profiles the Electron
  windows kept in `~/.config/amethystora-<app>`.
- `apps/Cargo.lock` pins every crate by checksum. Renovate's cargo manager bumps them, gtk-rs and ICU4X
  each as one group. The licences of the crates built into the program ship in
  `/usr/share/licenses/amethystora-apps/crates`, beside `CRATES`, their list, and `build-apps.sh` fails
  on a crate without a licence file of its own.
- The apps stage has Node as well, which runs `20-tests.sh`'s checks written in JavaScript
  (`check-manual.js`, `check-translations.js`) from where the stage is mounted, `/apps-stage`, and
  Notes' compatibility tests: the image carries no Node.
- The VM lab drives a window as a person would, through its accessibility tree
  (`tests/vm/suites/atspi.py`).

### The manual

The Amethystora Manual (`amethystora-manual`, `Super+F1`, "Manual" in the Amethystora menu) is the
user documentation, shipped in the image so that it always describes the image it is on. Its pages
are the Markdown files in `system_files/shared/usr/share/amethystora/manual`, listed and grouped in
`pages.json`; the hotkeys page is `keybindings.md` one level up, which `ame desktop keybindings` also
shows. **Keep the manual accurate** when you change a command, recipe, hotkey, path or default that
it describes, and add to it when you add something a user would look for there.

- Link between pages as files (`updates.md#rolling-back`). `build_files/shared/check-manual.js`
  runs in `20-tests.sh` and fails the build on a page that is missing or a link that lands nowhere.
- `07-debrand.sh` rewrites every Universal Blue name in the image except on a line that
  also carries a copyright or licence phrase, or a comment that opens with a credit (`# Written by`,
  `# Modified by`, `# Source:`), so upstream is credited only that way (`about.md`).
- The window is `apps/manual`, one of the Amethystora apps. It only shows the manual's own pages, opens
  web links in the browser, and follows the theme's palette. The sidebar draws the same wordmark as
  Security.
- A page translated into another language is `manual/<language>/<page>.md` (the hotkeys page too, as
  `manual/<language>/keybindings.md`). Weblate writes them from the English, paragraph by paragraph, so
  edit the English only. A translated page's headings take the ids of the English page's headings in
  the same order, so `updates.md#rolling-back` lands in every language; `check-manual.js` checks the
  translations' links against the English headings and warns when a translation has a different number
  of headings.

### Translations

The Manual, Security, Updates, Logs, Notes, Control and Backups follow the session's language, through
`apps/common/src/i18n.rs`. The English text in the code is the key: `t!("Update now")`,
`t!("Last updated {when}", when = ...)`, and plurals and variants in ICU MessageFormat
(`{count, plural, one {# file} other {# files}}`).

- The first argument of `t!`, `t_parts!` and `t_markup!` is always a string literal, a whole sentence or
  label: never fragments joined into a sentence. Text an app reads from data goes through
  `i18n::dynamic()` and is listed in `check-translations.js`'s `DATA`, which already lists the Manual's
  section names and every app's launcher.
- Each app's catalogs are `locale/<language>.json` in `system_files/shared/usr/lib/amethystora-<app>/resources/app`,
  where the Electron windows had them and Weblate writes them, keyed by the English. `locale/en.json`
  lists every message and is what Weblate translates from: after changing a message, run
  `node build_files/shared/check-translations.js --write --po po system_files/shared`, which reads the
  messages from `apps/` and rewrites it and `po/amethystora.pot`. `20-tests.sh` runs the same check
  without `--write`.
- Dates, numbers, sizes and lists go through `i18n` (`i18n::date()`, `i18n::days()`, `i18n::list()`,
  `i18n::number()`, `i18n::unit()`), never `format!`: ICU4X writes them as Chromium's Intl did, which
  `apps/common/tests/intl.rs` holds them to. Data that must read left to right in any language (paths,
  commands, ids) is set `gtk::TextDirection::Ltr`. GTK lays the rest out right to left for Arabic, and a
  stylesheet rule that names a side has its `:dir(rtl)` counterpart.
- The security report, the app permissions and Control's list translate with gettext (`gettext`,
  `eval_gettext` and `eval_ngettext`, values as shell variables), and the Security and Control apps show
  their words as they come. Never pass the report's or the helpers' text through `t!`.
- **The `ame` recipes** (`usr/share/amethystora/just/*.just`, each in `check-translations.js`'s `SHELL`
  list) say what they say through gettext too: `/usr/bin/ame` exports `TEXTDOMAIN=amethystora`, and a
  shebang recipe that prints or asks `source gettext.sh` after `set -euo pipefail`. A sentence is one
  message (a wrapped `echo` is merged), the values the user types (`on`, `off`, ids, `ERASE`), command
  names, `usage:` lines and anything a program parses stay as they are, and a `case` on what `gum choose`
  printed compares the translated labels (computed once into variables) as well as the ids.
- **Notifications are translated per account**, in `amethystora-notify-users`, not by the callers: the
  callers run as root, which has no session language. A caller marks a message with `N_ '...'` (and
  `N_n SUMMARY PLURAL '...' '...'` for a plural), exports the `${NAME}` values and passes the
  unexpanded text with `--msgid` (`--msgid-summary`, `--msgid-body`, `--plural` and `--count`, `--footer`
  for one more message after text that is not one); the helper takes each account's language from
  AccountsService (`Language=`, else `/etc/locale.conf`), runs `eval_gettext` under `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
  LANGUAGE=...`, and only then cleans the text with `amethystora-security-text`. The label of every
  `--action` is translated the same way. What the security watcher found, the driver check's finding and
  the pools of disks' news are text of their own and stay English; only the sentences around them are
  messages. `check-translations.js` reads `N_`, `N_n` and `_('...')` (a GNOME Shell extension's own, the
  widgets', in domain `amethystora` through `"gettext-domain"` in its `metadata.json`).
- `translate-desktop.py` writes each launcher's translated `Name`, `GenericName`, `Comment` and
  `Keywords` from the app's catalogs at build time: edit the English in the `.desktop` file only.

### The Security app

Amethystora Security (`amethystora-security`, **Security** in the app grid) is the security report and
the virus scanner, in place of the report's terminal launcher and ClamUI. Its checks live in one
script, `system_files/shared/usr/libexec/amethystora-security-status`: `ame security status` prints
it and the app asks it for `--json`, so a check added or changed there reaches both. Never write a
check into the recipe or the app. The app runs only the commands that script names, in a terminal
(`amethystora-in-terminal`). What a scan finds is only reported unless `ON_DETECTION` in
`/etc/amethystora/security.conf` (default `report`) says quarantine or delete, and then only through
`/usr/libexec/amethystora-quarantine`, which scans each file again first; never add `--move` or
`--remove` to a scan. `/usr/libexec/amethystora-security-config` is the one reader of that file.
Starting the whole-machine scan without a password is all `50-amethystora-virus-scan.rules` allows.
clamd runs only while something scans: `clamd@scan.socket` starts it, in the foreground so that it keeps
the socket it is handed, and `amethystora-clamd-idle.timer` stops it when no scan and no real-time
scanning needs it. The socket's folder is Fedora's (0710 `clamscan:virusgroup`), so an account scans with
`clamscan`, as before.
Network protection, the app's **Network** page, is Suricata inline on the machine's own traffic
(`amethystora-ips.service`, `/usr/libexec/amethystora-ips`), off until `NETWORK` in that file says
`watch` or `block`; only `block` cuts anything off. It fails open at every layer: the queue's `bypass`
in `amethystora-ips.nft`, and the fail-open, exception and stream settings
`build_files/shared/ips-config.py` writes into the configuration it derives from the package's. Keep it
that way: a failure must cost inspection, never the network.

**The locked session** (`plans/done/PLAN-locked-session.md`): the system disk cannot close while the
session is only locked, so two things come close. `ame security usb locked`, USB protection's third state
beside `off` and `on`, is GNOME's own lock-screen USB protection: gnome-settings-daemon's plugin, in every
session on the screen and at the login screen, blocks new devices while locked and lets plain keyboards and
mice through. The image adds configuration only: `usbguard-dbus.service`, masked in every other state
(D-Bus would start it, and the plugin's allow-all rule would undo `on`), the three calls the plugin makes
granted to the active session (`50-amethystora-usb-lockscreen.rules`), and its two dconf keys locked. The
report and the recipe call it `locked` whenever `usbguard.service` is enabled and the D-Bus service is not
masked. The private folder (`ame security private-folder`) is `~/Private`, a gocryptfs mount of
`~/.local/share/amethystora/private`, and `/usr/libexec/amethystora-private-folder` is the one place it is
handled, always as the account. It is never open without `amethystora-private-folder-watch.service`, which
open starts before mounting and which closes the folder on `ActiveChanged(true)`, on `PrepareForSleep(true)`
under a delay inhibitor, and however it ends (`ExecStopPost`): it fails closed. The password goes from
gocryptfs's prompt or zenity straight into gocryptfs, never into a variable, argument or file. Closing
stops gocryptfs's scope without waiting for programs and takes away the folder's thumbnails and recent
files; closed, `~/Private` is 0500 (fusermount3 mounts only where its owner can write, so it is 0700 for the
moment of mounting). `test-private-folder.sh` checks it against stand-ins, `tests/vm/suites/86-locked-session.sh`
on a machine.

The security watcher (`amethystora-security-watch`, on a 15-minute timer, or on each audit event when
`REALTIME_WATCH=on`) reads the audit log per key, the journal, `/etc` against `/usr/etc`, setuid files
outside `/usr` and listening ports, writes what only root can see to
`/var/lib/amethystora/security/status.json` for the report, and runs the report to notify when a watched
check turns bad. It also looks at what each account's session finds first: a command in `~/.local/bin`,
`~/bin` or Homebrew's prefix named like a system one, and a launcher in `~/.local/share/applications` that
no container export made. The audit rules ship one file per key in `/usr/share/amethystora/audit`, which
`amethystora-audit-home-rules` writes into `/etc/audit/rules.d/60-amethystora.rules` at every boot, beside
the per-home rules (`persistence`, `user-programs`). Where the kernel takes it, the **file-watch sensor**
records those keys instead, without audit's per-system-call cost (`apps/sensor`, `amethystora-sensor`,
`plans/done/PLAN-audit-cost.md`): the generator probes it once a boot and, for every key it covers,
writes a `/run/amethystora/sensor/{plan,watch.list}` line from the same shipped rules rather than an audit
rule, so the kernel loads only `-a never,task`; the watcher then reads that key from the sensor's own log
(`sensor-KEY` checkpoint) and auditd's for the rest. A kernel the sensor cannot load on, or `ame security
audit-locked`, falls back to the audit rules unchanged. Nobody logs in before it is watching (`Type=notify`,
before `systemd-user-sessions.service`, 30 s at most), and its path walk and `put_program` are BPF global
functions, which the verifier checks once: inline, they made its load take 14 s. A new audit key has to be
added to the watcher, to `amethystora-security-realtime`, to `amethystora-security-config` and to the sensor
(`src/bpf/sensor.h`'s keys and `src/keys.rs`); `20-tests.sh` fails otherwise, and checks
`amethystora-sensor --keys` against the watcher's. The app's **Containers** page is what
`amethystora-pkg containers list --json` says, run as the user.

**Every security feature is a switch, and off costs nothing** (the maintainer's rule of 2026-10-08). A
detection feature is a key in `security.conf`, defined in `amethystora-security-config` with its values,
words, group and how it applies (`--list --json`, the app's **Settings** page, `ame security settings`);
every unit that runs one reads its key in `ExecCondition=` (a drop-in for the packages' own: `clamd@`,
`clamav-freshclam`, `auditd`, `audit-rules`), and a key that is off writes no audit rule, so a line edited
by hand applies at the next boot. What the image enforces from the start (kernel settings, blocked
modules, FireWire, kernel arguments, firewall zone, fail2ban, lockout, the Flatpak override, virtual input, SSH
settings, signed updates) is switched by `/usr/libexec/amethystora-hardening`, one `ame security` command each, which keeps
what is off in `/etc/amethystora/hardening-off` and names the files it writes, which the watcher's drift
check accepts exactly. A feature switched off is `info` in the report with the command that turns it on,
never a warning; turned off any other way it still warns. A change made through a switch is noted
(`amethystora-security-config note`), and the watcher records it without notifying. `ame security
profile off|default|light|balanced|thorough` sets every detection key at once; no profile turns on, or
(but `off` and `default`) touches, a key whose `SENDS` is more than downloads, and each of those carries an
`EXPLAIN` that is shown and asked before it is turned on. `ame security allow report` accepts a check that
cannot be fixed on the machine, and `ame security allow KEY ENTRY` quietens a path or program a feature
keeps finding (`/usr/libexec/amethystora-security-allow`, which holds each feature's entry shape). Every
finding has an id, and a fact `allow=` when it can be allowed: **Allow…** on the Events page sends the id
only, and the program passes the entry the event holds. `test-security-switches.sh` checks all of it. A new
feature gets its switch with it, off by default.

**What looks for new threats** is the watcher's too, each part a key in group `detection` (or `network`,
`scans`), off as the image ships: `PROCESSES` (/proc read in a few bounded passes, never a fork per
process), `SELINUX_DENIALS`, `SNAPSHOT_WATCH` (`btrfs send --no-data` between hourly snapshots), `EXEC_WATCH`,
`AGENT_CLIS`, `CREDENTIALS` and `DECOY` (audit keys of their own, whose rules, or the sensor's watch-list
lines, the home generator writes for paths that exist, and the watcher reads from raw records with
`audit_records`), `BPF_PROGRAMS`, `CHAINS`,
`DNS_NAMES` (`amethystora-dns-names.service`, resolved's monitor), `BEHAVIOUR` (Falco, from falcosecurity's
pinned repository, run only by `amethystora-behaviour.service`; 0.45.0's probe does not load into Fedora 44's
kernel, so the build installs 0.45.1's release candidate from falcosecurity's `rpm-dev` until stable has
0.45.1, and goes back by itself; `20-tests.sh` fails below 0.45.1), the `YARA_*` sources (`amethystora-yara.service` as clamupdate, which splits and test-loads every
set, since one rule ClamAV cannot load can stop its whole database) and `NETWORK_FEEDS`/`NETWORK_HUNTING`
(`amethystora-ips due`). What only an account can see is read as that account by
`/usr/libexec/amethystora-security-reader` (`APP_PERMISSIONS`, `DEV_HOOKS`, `AGENT_CONFIG`), run with
`setpriv` and `timeout` for the accounts with a session in the last day, root keeping what it saw, and said to
that account alone (`amethystora-notify-users --user`). `OSPREY`, `TRIAGE` and `REPUTATION` send something
away and are in no profile. What turns each agent's checks off is `/usr/share/amethystora/agent-cli-flags`,
which must name every agent `amethystora-agent` offers. A finding carries `at=` (the snapshot Backups opens,
`--at=POINT`) and `tell=` where they apply; one the allowlist quietened carries `allowed` and builds no chain.
`test-security-watch.sh`, `test-security-reader.sh` and `test-yara.sh` plant each kind of finding. A library
loaded by `LD_PRELOAD` from outside `/usr`, and a session whose user manager gives every program a variable of
`/usr/share/amethystora/code-variables` (`systemctl --user show-environment`, run as the account with `setpriv` on its
manager's own socket: `-M USER@.host` from a system service starts a unit for every question), are `PROCESSES`'
too; the same list is the app permissions' `code` reach. `INJECTION`, an audit key of its own, is every attach to,
or read or write of, another program's memory by a login: the sensor's `fexit/security_ptrace_access_check`, which
returns at once unless the mode attaches (every `/proc/PID/stat` read asks it too), records the result, the call and
the program reached, and an `OBJ_PID` record with both mount namespaces (`omnt`, `mnt`); `injection.rules` is the
audit fallback, which sees no `/proc/PID/mem`. A program's own business (the same program, a neighbour outside the
shared folders, one sandbox other than the host's) and `/usr/share/amethystora/debuggers` are recorded only.

**App integrity** (`APP_INTEGRITY`, `/usr/libexec/amethystora-integrity`, Python with the OSTree bindings and
SQLite; `plans/done/PLAN-app-integrity.md`) checks the system's ostree repository, each deployment's
`.ostree.cfs`, the kernels and initramfs images in `/boot`, and every Flatpak installation against what their
signed updates installed, daily and on `/var/lib/flatpak/.changed` (`amethystora-integrity.timer` and
`.path`). Updates verify what they write, so root's files are trusted the first time and kept by their stat
(`integrity/system.db`), and only a changed ctime is read; an account's own installation is checked by content,
read as that account with its rows, root's, handed to it on a descriptor and its changes printed back. A
deploy's tree is compared with its commit, and its signature by fingerprint (Flathub's or a system remote's
keyring's), since ostree trusts every keyring in the repository's folder; what Flatpak writes itself (its
launchers, whose `Exec=` has to be its own `flatpak run` of the app, the `export/bin` wrapper, the deploy data,
extra data) is kept as written, and every entry of an installation's `exports` has to lead into an active deploy.
Its findings (`integrity/findings.jsonl`, all of them each run) reach the watcher as a reader's would, and
`status.json`'s `integrity` the report's `app-integrity` check; none can be allowed. A finding about the
system's own files means reinstalling: nothing repairs those, and `ame security app-integrity repair` only
fetches an app again. `test-app-integrity.sh` plants each kind of change against stand-ins.

The same helper holds the stricter settings, each off until turned on and kept in
`/etc/amethystora/hardening-on`: `kernel strict` (io_uring, ptrace, address randomisation, IPsec), extra
kernel arguments (`EXTRA_ARGS`; `proc_mem.force_override=ptrace` was one and is now the image's own in
`kargs.d`, which `system-setup.hooks.d/28-proc-mem.sh` adds where rpm-ostree updates), `time` (chrony with NTS only), `firewall-away` (the `amethystora-away`
zone by default, the networks named home keeping theirs), `network-daemons`, `block-bluetooth`,
`block-webcam`, `block-automount` and `block-user-extensions` (locked dconf keys in `local.d`),
`block-xwayland` (`--no-x11` in GNOME Shell's user unit, whose `ExecStart` `20-tests.sh` compares),
`flathub-verified`, `flatpak-password`, `noexec-temp` (marked `/etc/fstab` lines), `no-coredumps`,
`package-cooldown` (npm, pnpm and uv through `environment.d` and `profile.d`), `brew-attestations`,
`boot-password` (`grub2-setpassword`, which bootupd's static `01_users.cfg` reads), `locked-poweroff`
(`amethystora-locked-poweroff.timer`, enabled only while it is on, reads logind's `LockedHint`) and, on dx,
`vscodium-extensions` (`/etc/vscodium/policy.json`, which VSCodium reads under that name). Each says what
it costs before it is turned on; the report's `stricter` check names the ones that are on, and the watcher
says when one is turned off any other way. `ame security lockdown strict` is lockdown's own third level.

**Phone pairing is open only at home** (the maintainer's choice of 2026-10-08). The firewall has three
zones: `amethystora`, the default, which every network gets; `amethystora-home`, the same with GSConnect's
`kdeconnect` service, for the saved connections named home (`ame security home-networks`, kept in
`/etc/amethystora/firewall-home`, applied as each connection's `connection.zone`); and `amethystora-away`,
the default instead while `firewall-away` is on. With the Amethystora zone off, the home networks go back to
the default zone and the list stays. fail2ban bans in all three through the image's own
`action.d/amethystora-zones.conf`, since fail2ban's `firewallcmd-rich-rules` bans in the default zone alone.
`user-setup.hooks.d/18-home-networks.sh` tells an account with a phone paired, once, why it stopped connecting.

**What an account plants is only ever read.** Text somebody else wrote (a file name, a program's name
or command line, a launcher's `Exec=`, a host name, a rule's message) goes through
`/usr/libexec/amethystora-security-text` before it reaches a notification, a history line or a terminal:
`amethystora-notify-users` puts every notification through it, the watcher every finding, the scans every
file name they log, and the agent's prompts quote such text between lines of dashes as data. The watcher
tells only administrators (`--admins`), since its findings name other accounts' files. In a home the
watcher reads only plain files, never through a link, under `timeout`, and its unit has a
`TimeoutStartSec`. A finding carries its time, level, the part that found it (`key`), its account and
ATT&CK tactic: the history is JSON lines in `/var/log/amethystora-security-events.jsonl`, and
`events.json` beside `status.json` (root:wheel 0640) is the Security app's **Events** page.
`test-security-watch.sh` plants such text and checks every place it reaches.

What each Flatpak can reach beyond its sandbox is `/usr/libexec/amethystora-app-permissions --json`,
run as the user, which the report's **App permissions** check, the app's **Apps** page and `ame
security apps` all read. It compares `flatpak info --show-permissions` (every override applied) with the
app's manifest and its own overrides, and gives each reach an id from its fixed list; the report flags
the ids that leave the sandbox, whoever granted them. The app takes back only the account's own
overrides for an app the list says has some (`flatpak override --user --reset`), and takes one app's
network away or gives it back the same way (`--unshare=network`, `--share=network`), only for an app the
list says has it or had it taken. The global override
the image ships, `/etc/flatpak/overrides/global`, only applies through the link
`amethystora-flatpak-overrides.conf` makes in `/var/lib/flatpak/overrides`: Flatpak reads no other place.
It takes X11, the input devices and the Flatpak service from every app, and leaves `--device=all` to the
apps that ask for it.

Encrypted DNS (`ame security dns`, `/usr/libexec/amethystora-dns`) and a different address on each
network (`ame security mac`, `/usr/libexec/amethystora-mac`) are switched by the files their helpers write,
not by `security.conf`: a resolved drop-in with the resolver, `DNSOverTLS=yes` and `Domains=~.`, and
NetworkManager drop-ins copied from `/usr/share/amethystora/network`. The DNS one sets each network's own
servers to plain text, for its own names and the connectivity check, which would otherwise find every
network offline. Three things in the helper were settled from the programs' source, and `20-tests.sh`
holds them: systemd-resolved is reloaded, never restarted, since a reload keeps what NetworkManager and
Tailscale set on each network and a restart forgets it; networks connected already are changed with
`nmcli device modify`, since `nmcli device reapply` on an unchanged connection rebuilds nothing; and on a
network that wants a login first, the user unit `amethystora-dns-portal.service` (in the session, not a
NetworkManager dispatcher script) offers a ten-minute pause, which the person at the machine starts:
never pause it automatically, or any network could turn the encryption off.
The sidebar draws the boot splash's wordmark live, from `apps/common/assets/gem.svg` (written by
`branding/generate.mjs`) and Quicksand, with the generator's own sizes and glow.

### Logins

The image's authselect profile carries `with-pam-u2f` (`04-packages.sh`), `with-faillock` and
`with-fingerprint` (`08-hardening.sh`, the installer's own feature last), and no profile change may drop
them. realmd's stock login commands would (`authselect select sssd with-mkhomedir --force`), so
`/etc/realmd.conf` runs `/usr/libexec/amethystora-domain-logins` for all four: a join selects `sssd` or
`winbind` with the image's features and `with-mkhomedir`, and `realm leave` the image's own profile again,
with the image's `pam_winbind.conf`, which a winbind join edits and realmd does not put back.
The watcher takes that setup, and nothing else, as the image's (`amethystora-domain-logins check`): exactly
the features a join turns on, and every file in `/etc/authselect` as `authselect test` prints it, byte for
byte. Never rely on `authselect check`, which calls a file with a line added by hand valid. A
domain's accounts are not in `/etc/passwd` and are numbered far above 65534, so the per-account checks
find accounts by their folders in `/var/home` as well, and never filter on `uid < 65534`.

- **Parental Controls' allowed hours** are `pam_malcontent` in `login` and `sshd` only, by the
  maintainer's choice of 2026-10-05: GNOME Shell's own lock covers the desktop and keeps unsaved work,
  where the module would close the session. Keep it out of GDM's services, and keep its line before
  `account include`, where the `sssd` and `winbind` profiles' `sufficient pam_localuser.so` cannot end
  the stack ahead of it.
- **`ame security ssh-codes`** (off by default) makes a password login over SSH ask for a code from
  google-authenticator too. Its state is the two files `/usr/libexec/amethystora-ssh-codes` writes, an
  sshd drop-in and one line in `/etc/pam.d/sshd`, deliberately not a key in `security.conf`, which sshd
  cannot read. The watcher accepts exactly those two and nothing in between.
- **Both rest on `amethystora-pam.cil`**, an SELinux module `08-hardening.sh` installs. Fedora's policy lets
  neither the console's `login` nor `sshd-session` ask accountsservice, so without it `pam_malcontent` fails
  open and a child logs in at any hour; and it labels google-authenticator's new secret file only under a
  name the module no longer uses, so every login with a code fails. Neither shows in a build:
  `tests/vm/suites/83-logins.sh` makes each login as a person would.
- **`ame security duress`** (off by default) sets up a duress finger: one more finger that unlocks at the
  login and lock screens (`duress=allow` in `fingerprint-auth`), is refused at sudo, polkit and the text
  consoles (`duress=deny` in `system-auth`), and runs the owner's action as root either way, once per boot.
  pam_fprintd tells the finger apart only in the image's own fprintd build (`packaging/fprintd`, built in
  the Containerfile's `fprintd` stage): upstream's `VerifyFingerMatched` signal and its signals sent only to the
  claiming client, both unreleased after 1.94.5, plus Amethystora's patch to pam_fprintd. The feature
  `with-duress-fingerprint` is the per-machine switch: `08-hardening.sh` turns the link to `system-auth` and
  `fingerprint-auth` in the vendor `local`, `sssd` and `winbind` profiles into copies with one `{if}` each,
  so that with it off authselect writes the same bytes as before, and `amethystora-domain-logins` keeps it
  through a join or a leave. Under SELinux, GDM's and polkit's PAM may neither start a unit nor read
  fprintd's prints, so the module only reads `/etc/amethystora/duress.d/fingers` and sends `Run(uid)`,
  without waiting, to `amethystora-duress-service`, which runs from boot while the feature is on and has
  `/usr/libexec/amethystora-duress run UID SOURCE` check the sums of that source's action and of the print
  before anything runs. **A duress password** is the same feature for a typed password: the per-machine
  switch `with-duress-password` adds one `pam_exec.so ... /usr/libexec/amethystora-duress-pam` line after
  `pam_unix` (before faillock's authfail) in `system-auth` and `password-auth`, in all three vendor
  profiles, marked `{include if}` so that with it off authselect writes the same bytes as before (a false
  `{if}` leaves an empty line). That helper
  reads only `/etc/amethystora/duress.d/passwords` (`UID` and a yescrypt hash, never the password), decides
  allow or deny from `PAM_SERVICE` (only `gdm-password`, the login and the lock screen, unlocks; everywhere
  else is refused like a wrong password), and sends `RunPassword(uid)` (the finger sends `Run(uid)`). **The
  finger and the password each have their own function**: each runs its own script, `action-fingerprint` or
  `action-password` (an unrestricted root-level script, `env -i` but no time limit, with `DURESS_SOURCE` set),
  fires once per boot on its own, and is reported under its own check (`duress-finger`, `duress-password`);
  they share only the folder, the log, the service (`Run`/`RunPassword`) and the switch surface, and either
  feature turns the service on. A duress password needs no fingerprint reader. **Nothing may reveal whether an
  account has a duress finger or password**: no key in `security.conf`, nothing in the journal
  (`LogLevelMax=emerg`), one file for every account, the report and `status.json` silent until something keeps
  an action from running, and the agent skills told never to touch or mention it.

### The Updates app

System Updates (`amethystora-update`) replaces upstream's System Update launcher, which opened a
terminal on `ujust update`; `ame update` stays for the terminal. **Update now** starts
`uupd-manual.service`, the same updater the automatic updates run, which the person at the machine
may start without a password. The `uupd.rules` the uupd package ships (the ublue-os/packages build
installs it in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d`, not `/usr/share`) allows every verb on both of uupd's units to
anyone, `stop` and `set-property` included, so `40-amethystora-uupd.rules`, read before it, allows only
`start`, and only locally; anything else takes an administrator's password. The window never runs `bootc`, `flatpak` or `brew`
itself, with one exception: on a machine started from an older deployment than its default one,
**Keep this version** runs `pkexec bootc rollback`, after an administrator's password
(`amethystora-update-alert.service` says so at login and opens the window). It follows uupd's JSON log
in the journal and reads the deployments from `rpm-ostree status`. If uupd changes the `Updating`,
`module_fail` or `Updates Completed Successfully` messages it logs, update `apps/update/src/backend.rs` to match.
**Restart now** finishes an update with a soft reboot (systemd's, the system's programs only) when it keeps the
kernel, its initramfs, its arguments and the SELinux policy as they are: `/usr/libexec/amethystora-soft-reboot`
says when (bootc's `softRebootCapable`, then no loaded driver in another version and nothing waiting on the
firmware; never on a sealed image), mounts the staged deployment at `/run/nextroot` (`ostree admin
prepare-soft-reboot`) and asks logind for the restart as the user, which logind then makes a soft reboot, with its
own polkit questions still asked. Before that it adds `x-initrd.attach` to the crypttab lines of the LUKS partitions
the system runs from, which Anaconda leaves out: without it their cryptsetup unit stops at shutdown and takes the
update's mounts under `/run/nextroot` with it, and the machine comes up in emergency mode (ostreedev/ostree#3503,
found in the lab). `50-amethystora-soft-reboot.rules` lets anyone ask its status, and the person at
the machine prepare one, without a password. GNOME's restart dialog only restarts the computer, so the window asks
first itself, and leaves the restart to that dialog when an app inhibits logging out. `ame update restart` is the
same in a terminal. An update is only ever quick because `19-initramfs.sh` keeps out of the initramfs what changes
with every build (the build's version in os-release, the out-of-tree drivers modules-load.d names): keep it so
(`20-tests.sh` checks, and `tests/vm/suites/89-soft-reboot.sh` stages derived images and restarts through the
window). After an
update started there, it starts the account's `amethystora-pkg-upgrade.service` and shows it as the
**Containers** step, which reuses the step the window keeps for uupd's own distrobox module; a
container's failure shows there only, never as a failed system update. Its **Firmware** section asks
fwupd (`fwupdmgr get-updates --json`, no password) and installs in a terminal (`fwupdmgr update`), where
fwupd asks before a restart; `fwupd-refresh.timer`, which `17-cleanup.sh` enables because Fedora leaves
it to GNOME Software, fetches what LVFS has. `amethystora-update-alert` says at login, once for each
release, that firmware waits, and the security report's `firmware` check names it. The top bar draws the same wordmark as Security.

### The Logs app

Amethystora Logs (`amethystora-logs`, **Logs** in the app grid) replaces GNOME Logs, which
`amethystora.preinstall` leaves out and `system-setup.hooks.d/21-retire-gnome-logs.sh` uninstalls,
once, from a machine that already had it. It is read-only: it runs
`journalctl` as the user, and nothing else but a terminal, the Manual and the agent's diagnosis on what
the program picked, so administrators (`wheel`) see the whole machine and anyone else their own session.
`apps/logs/src/backend.rs` builds every `journalctl` argument from the window's choices: an app has to be
one it found with `journalctl --field`, a unit or program only ever reaches it as the value of `--unit`,
`--user-unit` or `--identifier`, and the search only as the value of `--grep`. Keep it that way, and
never pass a string typed in the window as an argument of its own. Its manual section is
`troubleshooting.md#the-logs`. The sidebar draws the same wordmark as Security, and blinks the gem's stem
while it reads the journal.

### The Notes app

Amethystora Notes (`amethystora-notes`, **Notes** in the app grid) is the notes and to-do app, in
place of Joplin and Planify: notebooks, Markdown notes with tags, attachments, history and a trash,
and tasks in an inbox or projects with sections, dates, repeats, reminders, priorities, labels and
subtasks. It imports Joplin's JEX export and Planify's JSON backup. Nothing is synced and it opens no
connection: keep it that way, and keep Joplin and Planify off the Flatpak lists (`20-tests.sh`
checks). Everything is in `~/.local/share/amethystora-notes`. When encrypted (offered, and chosen by
default, on first run), the data and each attachment are sealed with AES-256-GCM under a random key,
which is itself sealed under a key derived from the passphrase with scrypt. An encrypted vault reads
only sealed files. Turning encryption on or off and a new key (**Change the key as well**, on by default
when the passphrase changes) write everything into `next/` first, then `vault.json`, and move into
place only what the vault's key then fits. The program holds the key only while unlocked, and opens an
attachment only to show or save it. A note's Markdown is rendered as the Manual's is
(`apps/common/src/markdown.rs`), with raw HTML shown as text. Keep both properties. The files are the
ones the Electron window wrote, in the same formats: `apps/notes/tests/compat.rs` opens what that
window wrote, and has its own code (`electron.js`, on the apps stage's Node) read what this one writes.
Its manual page is `notes.md`. Its lock screen lifts the gem's stem while the passphrase is checked.

A passkey (**Settings**, **Add a passkey**) opens the notes beside the passphrase, never in its place:
the same random key sealed once more, under the secret a FIDO2 security key computes with `hmac-secret`
for the credential and salt kept in `vault.json`. It asks the security key through `fido2-token`,
`fido2-cred` and `fido2-assert` (`fido2-tools`, in `04-packages.sh`), which take their parameters and
the PIN on stdin, and always with its PIN or a fingerprint (`pin=true` or `uv=true`): a touch alone
must never open the notes. The credential is made with `credProtect` level 3 (`fido2-cred -c 3`), and a
key without `credProtect` is refused: a key of the first FIDO2 generation may otherwise give the same
`hmac-secret` for a touch alone. Such a key will not say whether it holds a credential without the PIN,
so unlocking tries each passkey in turn. Nothing is stored on the security key, and a backup carries
no passkey.

### The Control app

Amethystora Control (`amethystora-control [page]`, **Control** in the app grid, `Super+Ctrl+Shift+C`) is
the window for Amethystora's own settings outside security: the theme, wallpaper and transition, the
window layout, widgets, the terminal's greeting and tools, games, Android apps, drawing tablets, the AUR,
web apps, the add-ons, the AI agent, the image and stream, developer mode, an image of one's own, the CPU
scheduler, the firmware, freeing space, the pools of disks, starting over, and the setup file. What it shows is one script,
`system_files/shared/usr/libexec/amethystora-control-list`: `ame control` prints it and the window asks
it for `--json`, so a setting added or changed there reaches both. Never write a setting into the window.

- **Every change is an `ame` command.** The script writes each command in plain words, so that the check
  in `20-tests.sh` for commands that do not exist sees them, and a setting no `ame` command reaches gets
  a recipe first. A command marked `terminal: true` opens in `amethystora-in-terminal`; every command
  that asks something, explains a risk or needs a password is marked so. One run directly has no
  terminal and must never prompt.
- **The window runs only what the list gave.** An entry's id and one of the values the list gave pick
  the command the list has for it, which `apps/control/src/backend.rs` runs as an argument vector. The
  only things typed in the window, a slider's number, a new widget's name and a repository to trust, are
  checked there first; the repository against `amethystora-trust-image`'s own expression, which
  `20-tests.sh` compares. The key is picked in a file dialog.
- **Security stays in Security,** by the maintainer's rule: nothing in the script or the window runs
  `ame security`. The sidebar opens Security, Updates (whose switch automatic updates keep) and Backups
  (whose controls the backup keeps). The one exception, by the maintainer's choice of 2026-10-18, is the AI
  agent's root mode and lock (`ame agent root`, `ame agent lock`), which govern the agent rather than a
  security feature (see Agentic features).
- **The list logic is `apps/control-core`**, a crate without GTK, which the agent's `change` tool uses too,
  so that both change a setting the same way; Control only says each refusal in its own words.
- **Pools of disks** are the System page's Disks group: a `disks` entry with one row for each pool from
  `amethystora-raid status --json`, each with the actions the list gives it, which `backend.rs` runs with
  `pool(action, id)`. Every one of them is an `ame system raid` command in a terminal (`20-tests.sh`).
- **Reset settings**, before Start over, is `ame system reset-settings` (`/usr/libexec/amethystora-reset-settings`):
  the account's dconf, less its language, keyboard and accessibility, and the machine's `/etc` against
  `/usr/etc`, each saved first for `undo`. It keeps what the machine knows (`KEEP`) and everything Security
  sets: its `SECURITY` list is the watcher's `DRIFT_PATHS`, which `test-reset-settings.sh` holds it to, and a
  unit a security switch enables or masks goes in its `KEEP_UNITS`.

Its manual page is `control.md`, and each card links to its own section. The sidebar draws the same
wordmark as Security, and the app grid's icon is the tile `generate.mjs` draws (`amethystora-control.svg`).

### The Backups app

Amethystora Backups (`amethystora-backups [FOLDER | status]`, **Backups** in the app grid, **Open With**
on a folder in Files) is the home folder as it was at any hour the hourly snapshots
(`amethystora-home-snapshot`) or the daily restic backup (`amethystora-backup`) kept, on one timeline, and
putting back what was lost. What it shows is one script, `/usr/libexec/amethystora-restore`, run as the
user: `status`, `points`, `ls`, `versions`, `put-back` and `open`, each with `--json`. `ame backup
snapshots` and `ame security ransomware restore` take their lists from `points` too, and the security
report's `backup-runs` check reads `status`. Never work out a point, a path or a state in the window.

- **The window passes back only what the helper said.** A point is one `points` gave, a path one `ls` listed
  (or a folder above it, or the folder the window was opened on), and a way to put back one of
  `keep-both`, `replace` and `skip`; each is an argument of its own. The helper refuses a path that
  leaves the home or starts with `-`, and puts back only inside the home.
- **Nothing deletes.** Neither the helper nor the window runs `restic forget`, `prune`, `rewrite` or
  `key`, restore's `--delete`, or `btrfs subvolume delete`; `20-tests.sh` greps for them. Putting back
  adds what is missing and keeps a file that changed beside the old one (`name (2026-10-04 14.00).ext`)
  unless the window was told otherwise. Looking runs restic with `--no-lock`, so it works against an
  append-only repository; `restic mount` is not used.
- **The backup's controls stay here,** by the maintainer's choice: **Set up** runs `ame backup setup` in
  a terminal, the daily run is `ame backup on|off`, and **Back up now** starts `amethystora-backup.service`
  and follows it in the journal. The hourly snapshots are a security switch: the window shows them and
  opens Security, and never runs `ame security`.
- **The last good backup** is the stamp `amethystora-backup` writes to
  `~/.local/state/amethystora/backup-last-success`. A daily run with none for 7 days is stale, which the
  window and the report's `backup-runs` check say. The security watcher runs as root, sees no account's
  backup, and does not notify about it.
- Déjà Dup is off `amethystora.preinstall`, and `20-tests.sh` keeps it off. An account whose Déjà Dup
  backed it up on a schedule is told once, after it is gone (`user-setup.hooks.d/19-deja-dup.sh`). There is
  no retire hook: a machine that kept Déjà Dup keeps backing up with it.

Its manual section is `security.md#backups`. The sidebar draws the same wordmark as Security; the app grid's icon is drawn for the image in `build_files/shared/candy-icons`
(named in `NOTICE`), with the tile `generate.mjs` draws (`amethystora-backups.svg`) for other themes.

### Pools of disks

`ame system raid` (`/usr/libexec/amethystora-raid`, run as the user, asking sudo for each step that
needs root) makes btrfs RAID pools from spare disks with one command, `ame system raid create`, and
replaces, adds, opens and forgets them. Its plan, done and tested in the VM lab on 2026-10-20, is
`plans/done/PLAN-raid.md`.

- **btrfs's own RAID, nothing installed.** Every layout is offered, each with its cost said first: two
  and three copies, raid10, raid5 and raid6 with btrfs's own warning, and combined. Metadata is raid1 on
  two disks and raid1c3 from three, never parity.
- **Nothing erases a disk it should not.** A disk is offered only when nothing holds it (mounted, swap,
  LUKS, md, LVM, a member of a btrfs or of a pool that did not mount, zram, read-only), and erased only
  in a terminal after `ERASE` is typed, with the list read again just before: there is no `--yes`, and
  `test-raid.sh` checks the filter and that nothing runs without a terminal.
- **A pool** is a GPT partition per disk named `raid-POOL-N`, LUKS2 under it unless the user said no
  (key in `/etc/cryptsetup-keys.d/raid-POOL.key`, one recovery key in every disk's slot 1), lines in
  `/etc/crypttab` and `/etc/fstab` with `nofail`, and the fstab line marked `x-amethystora-raid`, which
  is how the status knows of a pool that did not mount. A pool that lost a disk is mounted degraded only
  by `ame system raid mount`, never by itself and never in fstab.
- **One source of state:** `amethystora-raid status --json`, which needs no root (sysfs, lsblk,
  findmnt, `btrfs filesystem show` on a mounted pool, and what the services write to
  `/var/lib/amethystora/raid`). Control's Disks group and the check read it; its sentences are each
  reader's own. Security's report has no RAID check, by the maintainer's choice.
- **Watched:** `amethystora-raid-check.timer` (hourly, as root) reads SMART into `disks.json` and
  notifies, with an **Open Control** button, what changed since `last.json`, which is written only once
  somebody was logged in to tell. `amethystora-raid-scrub.timer` scrubs monthly on mains power and
  resumes a scrub a suspend cut short. Both are enabled in every image and skip a machine with nothing to
  watch (`ExecCondition=... present`).
- **The system's disks:** `ame system raid mirror` converts an installer-made multi-disk `single`
  system to raid1 (2a). `mirror DISK` copies a system on one disk, laid out as the installer does it,
  onto a new disk at least as large (2b): an ESP of its own and a firmware entry for its shim, `/boot`
  made the RAID1 `md-boot` (metadata 1.0, so each half reads as ext4 and bootupd finds both ESPs through
  it), the root's LUKS with the same passphrase (its `rd.luks.uuid` written into every boot entry, before
  `/boot` is copied: ostree's `--append-if-missing` skips a key already there) and btrfs raid1. It then
  restarts once with `BootNext` on the new disk; `amethystora-raid-mirror.service` finishes only after a
  start that came from it (`BootCurrent`), and before `boot.mount`, while nothing holds `/boot`: the first
  disk's `/boot` joins the array, its ESP is pointed at it, fstab follows, and `amethystora-raid-boot.service`
  labels the mounted mirror for SELinux. Never on a sealed image.
- **Starting with a disk dead:** 64-btrfs.rules keeps a btrfs with a member missing waiting forever, and
  systemd will not add the policy (#36886). On a system over several disks, `amethystora-raid-boot.service`
  writes the boot menu entry **Start with a disk missing** into `/boot/grub2/custom.cfg`, between
  `amethystora-raid` markers, at every start and again at shutdown after ostree finalized an update: the
  default deployment's entry with `rootflags=...,degraded` and `rd.luks.options=...,nofail`, and a 5 s menu.
  Its `ostree=` stays the `/ostree/boot.N` link ostree wrote, the only kind ostree-prepare-root follows.
  The dracut module `amethystora-degraded` (initramfs only) marks the btrfs ready when, and only when,
  `rootflags` asks for `degraded`, and then has dracut's initqueue wait no longer for every `rd.luks.uuid`
  (crypt's `90-crypt.sh`, which knows no `nofail`): nothing mounts around a disk that is only slow unless a
  person chose that entry. `replace system` puts a new disk in its place (ESP, `md-boot` half and LUKS when mirrored).
- **A disk that comes back** has the old copies of what was written while it was away, which btrfs
  counts as errors: the check and the boot write the disks they see missing to `missing.json`, the status
  calls such a disk `returned` rather than counting errors, and **Put the copies back** scrubs, soft-
  balances, re-adds its `md-boot` half and resets its counters.
- `ame security disk-unlock` and the report's disk-unlock tile take the system's LUKS partitions from
  `amethystora-raid root-luks`, never the first LUKS device on the machine, which may be a pool's. On
  an image that is not sealed it enrols the TPM only with a PIN: there the boot menu and initramfs are
  plain files, and a shell from the boot menu or a look-alike LUKS volume changes neither PCR 7 nor 14.
  The watcher reads the LUKS header into `status.json` (`disk_unlock`), and the report's
  `disk-unlock-pin` check names a key set up without one.

### The transitions

Amethystora Transitions (`amethystora-transitions@iarsslen.github.io`, written for this image and
kept in `system_files/shared/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions`, not a submodule) reveals a new theme
or wallpaper with an animation, as swww does on Hyprland. It freezes the screen in GNOME Shell's own
`screenTransition` actor, which makes the background manager swap the wallpaper at once instead of
fading it, and once nothing has changed for 300 ms a GLSL shader opens the picture onto the new
desktop. `amethystora-theme` calls `Hold` and `Release` on `/org/amethystora/Transitions` (on
`org.gnome.Shell`) around a theme switch so that it is one transition; a change to a watched
background or interface key starts one by itself, and the Dark Style toggle reaches it through
`screenTransition.run()`. The screen is never held for more than five seconds, and nothing is held
while GNOME's animations are off. Its schema is in `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas`, for `ame desktop
transition`. `stage.paint_to_content` took a colour-state argument in GNOME 50: check that call before
adding a GNOME to its `shell-version`, which `20-tests.sh` requires.

### Widgets

Amethystora Widgets (`amethystora-widgets@iarsslen.github.io`, in `system_files` like the transitions)
is the top bar's counterpart of Omarchy's bar plugins, made for agents to write. A widget is a folder in
`~/.config/amethystora/widgets` holding `widget.json` and a command; the extension runs the command and
shows what it prints as a label, an icon and a menu, and loads a widget again whenever its folder
changes. Widgets are deliberately not code inside GNOME Shell: on Wayland the shell is the compositor,
so a mistake in it ends the session, and new code only loads after logging out. `protocol.js` is the one
definition of the format and `runner.js` the one way a command runs (its own session, a fixed `PATH`,
`WIDGET_ID`, `WIDGET_DIR`, `WIDGET_STATE`, 30 seconds per run); `check.js`, which `amethystora-widgets
run` is, imports both, so what the check passes is what the bar shows. Keep it that way. The
`amethystora-widgets` skill documents the format for agents and `widgets.md` for users: change them with
`protocol.js`. `amethystora-widgets make` and `fix` hand the work to `amethystora-agent`, and the
examples in `/usr/share/amethystora/widgets/examples` pass the check in `20-tests.sh`. Nothing here may
run as root or ship a widget that is on by default.

### Packages from other distributions

`amethystora-pkg` (`/usr/bin/amethystora-pkg`, a bash script; `amepkg` is the link `17-cleanup.sh`
makes, because the build's rsync skips links in `system_files`) makes distrobox containers from
templates and drives each with its own package manager. It reimplements Vanilla OS's Apx feature set
from a written description, clean-room: never read or copy Vanilla OS projects' source, help text or
artwork, and never ship their definitions or community templates. No command, menu, app or string
names Vanilla OS, Apx, VSO or Sideload; the manual says once, in `software.md` (and once in each of its translations), that `import` reads
Apx's YAML files, and `20-tests.sh` fails on any other mention. `ame pkg` runs it too, under `ame`,
the command over Amethystora's own; `amy` is a Homebrew formula, so nothing may take that name.

- Built-in templates and managers are JSON in `system_files/shared/usr/share/amethystora/pkg` (the AUR's
  `paru` and `arch-aur` under `aur/`, shown only while `~/.config/amethystora/aur` exists, which `ame
  apps aur` writes); the user's own are in `~/.local/share/amethystora/pkg`. Every built-in template
  image is pinned by digest, the pins shipping in the signed image; Renovate follows each tag's digest
  (custom manager, depType `pkg-template`) and never moves a template to a new release, which is done
  by hand with its `description`. Images are pulled by digest before `distrobox create`, so neither the
  pin nor `policy.json` can be skipped. Leave the policy's catch-all as it is, and do not re-sign third-
  party images under `ghcr.io/iarsslen`. `import` shows what a definition runs and asks before keeping
  it (`--yes` skips that): a pin chosen by a template's author proves nothing about the image. A
  template's packages are names, and the AUR packages a paru template names are left to `install`.
- `policy.json` checks `registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/leap` against openSUSE's two container keys
  (`keyPaths`, containers/image 5.33 and later), both from openSUSE's `openSUSE-build-key` package,
  whose RPM signature was checked against openSUSE's project key: `opensuse-container-key.pub`, the
  2048-bit key that signs openSUSE's published images today, converted to PEM from the package's
  OpenPGP file, and `opensuse-container-key-2023.pub`, its successor, as the package ships it. The rule
  covers Leap only, by the maintainer's choice: the rest of openSUSE's namespace holds build projects
  (infrastructure, tools, templates, Factory's staging) that sign with keys of their own. Every update
  is verified against the same file, so `20-tests.sh` has skopeo load it.
- Containers carry `amethystora.pkg.*` labels and real names `pkg-<name>`; distrobox's own
  `manager=distrobox` label stays, since distrobox, DistroShelf and Ptyxis find containers by it. Only
  labelled containers are listed or touched.
- `--json` field names are documented in `software.md#in-scripts`: keep them stable.
- AUR packages are built only after their PKGBUILD has been shown on a terminal, `--yes` or not, and are
  never upgraded unattended; the AUR's own metadata is shown first.
- `amethystora-pkg-upgrade.timer` (user, enabled with `--global`) upgrades the containers daily and,
  when its timer starts it (`$TRIGGER_UNIT`), skips a run when uupd's hardware checks would fail, with
  the thresholds of `/etc/uupd/config.json`. uupd's own distrobox module stays off there.
- A `.deb` or `.rpm` opens in `amethystora-pkg-install.desktop`, the default for both types in
  `/etc/xdg/mimeapps.list`: a ClamAV scan, provenance, and Flathub or the container's repositories
  offered first. The security report's two-week check on the containers is in
  `amethystora-security-status`, like every check.

Everything it installs is fetched on the user's machine from its source (DistroShelf from Flathub,
images from their registries, packages inside containers), so `NOTICE` and `SOURCES` do not change for
it.

### New machines

- `user-setup.hooks.d/17-welcome.sh` opens `amethystora-manual welcome` once per account, through
  `systemd-run --user`, because the setup service kills what it leaves behind. The Manual itself
  spawns nothing. Ninety seconds later, `/usr/libexec/amethystora-layout-offer` offers classic windows
  in a notification, which only `ame desktop layout classic` acts on. The classic layout is PaperWM
  turned off, remembered in `~/.config/amethystora/layout`, which `15-extensions.sh` reads so that the
  update that turns the image's extensions back on leaves PaperWM off.
- `amethystora-gpu-check.timer` offers the image whose driver drives the machine's NVIDIA card (PCI class
  `0x03`, vendor `0x10de`, by device ID, see Drivers), or the image without the driver on one with no card
  NVIDIA's driver drives, once per machine, through `amethystora-notify-users --action` and `ame system rebase IMAGE STREAM`. It
  never switches by itself; its state is `/var/lib/amethystora/gpu-check`.
- The hourly snapshots of the home folders are on from the first boot of a machine installed from an
  Amethystora ISO: both kickstarts leave `/var/lib/amethystora/new-installation`, which
  `system-setup.hooks.d/26-snapshots-new-installation.sh` acts on and removes. A machine updated into it
  keeps them as its owner left them.
- `amethystora-backup` stores `amethystora-setup-manifest`'s JSON beside each backup, as a restic
  snapshot tagged `amethystora-setup` (no secrets in it), and `ame restore-setup`
  (`/usr/libexec/amethystora-restore-setup`) makes the setup again from it, each step chosen first.
  Anything that can add a snapshot can write that manifest, an append-only repository's compromised
  client included, so nothing in it runs unread: it never runs the Brewfile it keeps (Ruby), installs
  Homebrew's names only, asks before each tap and each Flatpak remote the machine lacks, and checks every
  name as `ame setup` does. Its loops read on fd 3, so that what they run keeps the terminal to ask on.

### Your setup as a file

`ame setup save|diff|apply` (`/usr/libexec/amethystora-setup`, the `setup.just` group) keeps the
account's setup in `~/.config/amethystora/setup.json`: what `amethystora-setup-manifest` writes, less
the machine and everything that is an address or a script (the Flatpak remotes, the Brewfile, templates
and package managers of the account's own, the AUR's switch). A file can be shared, so it names things
only. Its settings are a fixed short list, and only where the account changed them from the image: the
layout, the dock's apps, keybindings by schema and key (the image's own custom keybindings by id, and
only their binding) and PaperWM's gaps. Never add a GNOME key that can hold a command, or a field that
is an address. The script refuses a file with a key or a name it does not know, `save` included;
`apply` shows what it adds and sets and asks first (`--yes` skips that), and takes nothing away without
`--remove`, which always asks in a terminal. `build_files/shared/test-setup.sh`, run by `20-tests.sh`
against stand-ins for flatpak, brew and GNOME, checks all of this. The manual page is `setup.md`.

### An image of your own

`iarsslen/amethystora-image-template`, a repository of its own, builds an image `FROM` the stable image,
signed with its owner's cosign key. Its build runs two scripts shipped here, so keep their arguments as
they are: `/usr/libexec/amethystora-trust-image` (`ame system trust-image` on a machine, before it
switches) writes the owner's key, a `registries.d` file and a `sigstoreSigned` policy entry for the
image's repository, and refuses Amethystora's own repositories; `/usr/libexec/amethystora-image-check`
fails a build that loosened the signature policy, carries Fedora's logo or release package, or lost the
`ame` commands, and `20-tests.sh` runs it on every Amethystora image. The image's policy takes a
repository it does not name unsigned (Fedora's `insecureAcceptAnything` for `docker`), which is why the
trust comes first. `ame system rebase` must keep taking signed images only. The manual's section is
`developer.md#an-image-of-your-own`.

### Sealed images

`:stable-sealed` is each of the six stable images sealed (`Containerfile.sealed`, after Fedora's sealed
test images, https://github.com/travier/fedora-atomic-desktops-sealed, CC0-1.0): a UKI signed with
Amethystora's Secure Boot key carries the composefs digest of the whole tree in its kernel command
line, and the initramfs mounts the system only with fs-verity required. Experimental and for new
installations only: bootc cannot move an ostree deployment to the composefs backend or back, so the
ostree images stay the default.

- **Built in the stable build job**, right after `just build-ghcr`: `just seal` builds `FROM` the local
  image, before it is rechunked. `build_files/sealed/00-sealed.sh` takes out rpm-ostree (with
  `rpm -e --nodeps`: tuned requires it on a bootc system, and dnf would take tuned-ppd with it), bootupd
  and GRUB, installs systemd-boot, copies `system_files/sealed`, sets `image-tag` to `stable-sealed`,
  ships the certificate as `/usr/share/amethystora/secure-boot/amethystora-uki.der`, rebuilds the
  initramfs with dracut's `bootc` module and the image's own `amethystora-sealed`, and writes `SOURCES`
  again. chunkah rechunks the tree **before** the digest: nothing may change the tree after `bootc
  container ukify` (`10-uki.sh`) has read it, and the UKI under `/boot/EFI/Linux` is the only thing
  added afterwards. `10-uki.sh` builds the UKI unsigned; `15-sign-uki.sh` signs it and systemd-boot in
  the `signer` stage, a pinned Fedora image with only sbsigntools added, the one place the Secure Boot
  key is mounted. Pin Fedora's image from `registry.fedoraproject.org` (the Justfile's `fedora_image`
  too): quay.io stops serving a digest of `fedora:44` as soon as Fedora moves the tag, which it does
  daily, and that broke sealing in October 2026. `20-tests-sealed.sh` checks the signatures, the
  digest and the command line. The UKI's kernel arguments are the image's `kargs.d`,
  there is no other way to add one, and they never include a debug shell.
- **Keys: shim and MOK** (the maintainer's choice of 2026-10-04, over replacing the firmware's PK, KEK
  and db). The private key is the `SECUREBOOT_KEY` secret, separate from the cosign key; its certificate
  is `secure-boot.crt`, which `just seal` checks the key against. Until both exist, and always for pull
  requests, `just seal` signs with a throwaway key and labels the image
  `org.amethystora.secure-boot-key=throwaway`, which CI never publishes. Never replace the certificate:
  every sealed machine trusts that one only.
- **Published** with gzip layers (the composefs backend cannot pull zstd:chunked yet, bootc-dev/bootc#2408),
  pushed twice, signed with cosign and attested, then removed from the runner before the rechunk needs
  the disk. It has no SBOM of its own. A failure fails a pull request, but never keeps the stable image
  from publishing (`continue-on-error`).
- **Installed** only by `iso/live/amethystora-install-sealed`, in the live ISO, since Anaconda cannot
  install the composefs backend: a whole disk, a 2 GiB ESP, a discoverable root partition (LUKS2, btrfs,
  subvolume `root`), `bootc install to-filesystem --composefs-backend`, then shim placed in
  `EFI/amethystora` in front of systemd-boot (`grubx64.efi`), a firmware boot entry, and every
  `/usr/share/amethystora/secure-boot/*.der` of the image queued with `mokutil`.
- **In the image**, a sealed machine is told apart by `/usr/share/amethystora/sealed`. It has no
  rpm-ostree, so read deployments through `/usr/libexec/amethystora-deployments`, which prints
  `rpm-ostree status --json`'s shape on both kinds of image (on a sealed one from `bootc status`,
  through pkexec and `50-amethystora-deployments.rules`), and branch on the marker for anything that
  changes kernel arguments: they cannot change there. `amethystora-signed-updates.service` does not run
  on it. The manual's `updates.md#sealed-images` describes it for users.
- **`amethystora-sealed` is what makes the seal hold; keep it.** bootc's initramfs does not by itself
  insist on fs-verity for the image the signed command line names; the details stay out of the
  repository until bootc has a fix.
  The module's `amethystora-sealed-verity.service` runs after `bootc-root-setup.service` and halts
  unless every composefs mount has `verity=require` (never the emergency target: its locked root
  account lets the boot continue). An install made by a kernel without fs-verity is refused the same
  way. Drop it only once bootc enforces this itself, and not before every machine's repository has
  fs-verity on `meta.json`, or they stop starting.
- **`systemd.import_credentials=no`** is in the sealed `kargs.d`: credentials from SMBIOS, a hypervisor
  or a TPM-encrypted file on the ESP could add a drop-in to any unit, the guard's included (shown in
  the VM with SMBIOS), and systemd's own units take root's password, SSH keys, udev rules and files
  from them. Plain ESP credentials are already ignored. Nothing in the image uses credentials.
- **Verified in a VM on 2026-10-10**, with the release key, QEMU and OVMF holding Microsoft's keys and
  the image's certificates in MokList: the firmware's fallback path starts shim, shim systemd-boot and
  the UKI; Secure Boot enabled, lockdown on, `composefs=` in `/proc/cmdline`, the root mount
  `verity=require`; a changed object reads as an I/O error; the same disk without our certificate stops
  at shim's Security Violation; the guard halts a disk whose image file lost fs-verity, also when an
  SMBIOS drop-in tries to switch it off (2026-10-11, with `systemd.import_credentials=no`); and `bootc
  switch` applies `policy.json` (an unsigned image under a `sigstoreSigned` rule is refused). Fedora's
  shim in the image carries both Microsoft's 2011 and 2023 signatures. **Not verified:** the MOK
  manager's enrolment screens, LUKS and the TPM, uupd updating a sealed machine, and real hardware.

### COPR Package Installation

COPR packages use the `copr_install_isolated()` helper function from `build_files/shared/copr-helpers.sh`:
```bash
# Install packages from COPR with isolated repo enablement
copr_install_isolated "ublue-os/staging" package1 package2

```

This function:
1. Enables the COPR repo
2. Immediately disables it
3. Installs packages with `--enablerepo` flag to prevent repo conflicts

### Making Package Changes
1. Edit the appropriate shell script in `build_files/base/` or `build_files/dx/`
2. Add packages to the appropriate array (`FEDORA_PACKAGES` or `COPR_PACKAGES`)
3. For version-specific packages, add them in the Fedora version case statement
4. Validate shell script syntax: `bash -n build_files/base/04-packages.sh`
5. Run pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
6. Test with container build if making critical changes

### Package Security Model
**CRITICAL**: Packages are split into separate arrays to prevent COPR repos from injecting malicious versions of Fedora packages:
- Fedora packages are installed first in bulk, from Fedora's repositories by name (`--repo=fedora --repo=updates`, and `updates-testing` on beta): the akmods Copr and negativo17's `fedora-multimedia`, which outranks Fedora's, are still enabled at that point
- COPR packages are installed individually with isolated repo enablement
- Every third-party repository's signing key is pinned by fingerprint: `pin_repo_key` (`copr-helpers.sh`, with the Copr projects' fingerprints in its table) fetches the key a repository file names, refuses any other, keeps it in `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg` and points the file at that copy, so that dnf never takes a key from the server; `20-tests.sh` fails on a pinned repository that still names one. A new repository or Copr project gets its fingerprint there
- RPM Fusion's release packages come from volunteer mirrors, and dnf checks no signature on a package given as a file or URL: `rpmfusion_release_install` takes RPM Fusion's keys from Fedora's signed `distribution-gpg-keys` and installs the release packages only with a valid signature
- Downloads outside a package manager are pinned by SHA-256 in the script that fetches them (Starship, the extensions.gnome.org uploads, candy-icons, Sweet), the apps' crates by `apps/Cargo.lock`'s checksums, the agent's embedding model by its revision and SHA-256 in `build-apps.sh` (its licences in `usr/share/licenses/potion-base-8M`, named in `NOTICE`), and Flathub is added from the base image's own `flathub.flatpakrepo` after its key is checked

### Licences and trademarks

The repository is Apache-2.0, and the image is not: it redistributes other people's work on their
terms. `NOTICE` is where each of those is named, and `20-tests.sh` checks what follows.

- **A file under another licence says so.** Name it in `NOTICE` and ship its licence in
  `system_files/shared/usr/share/licenses/<project>/`. The zsh configuration is Prezto's and zimfw's
  (MIT); `50-usb-realtek-net.rules` is GPL-2.0 and says so in its first lines.
- **Credits stay as their authors wrote them.** The udev rules name who wrote each and where
  (`ublue-os/config/pull/...`); `debrand.py` leaves such comment lines alone, and so should an edit.
- **Licence texts stay in the image.** Do not delete a package's documentation without first moving
  its licence, copyright and NOTICE files, as `05-override-install.sh` does.
- **Nobody else's logo.** Not in the icon theme (`10-icons.sh`), not in the Logo Menu
  (`06-branding.sh`), not from a setup hook. Fedora's guidelines ask a remix to carry neither
  `fedora-logos` nor `fedora-release`, and to describe itself without Fedora's name: say that
  Amethystora is built on Fedora, never that it is a Fedora desktop.
- **Source travels with what asks for it.** A package from RPM Fusion, negativo17 or Copr under the
  GPL, LGPL, MPL, EPL or CDDL has its source package fetched into the image by `source-manifest.sh`.

## Build System Deep Dive

### Justfile Structure
The `Justfile` is the central build orchestration tool with these key recipes:

**Validation Recipes:**
- `just check` - Validates Just syntax across all .just files
- `just fix` - Auto-formats Just files
- `just validate <image> <tag> <flavor>` - Validates image/tag/flavor combinations

**Build Recipes:**
- `just build <image> <tag> <flavor>` - Main build command (calls build.sh)
- `just build-ghcr <image> <tag> <flavor>` - Build for GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
- `just rechunk <image> <tag> <flavor>` - Rechunk image for optimization
- `just seal <image> <tag> <flavor>` - The sealed variant of a built image, `localhost/<image>:<tag>-sealed`
- `just secure-boot-key` - Makes the sealed images' Secure Boot key and `secure-boot.crt`, once

**Image/Tag Definitions:**
```bash
images: amethystora, amethystora-dx
flavors: main, nvidia-open, nvidia-lts
tags: stable, latest, beta
```

**Version Detection:**
- `just fedora_version <image> <tag> <flavor>` - Dynamically detects Fedora version from upstream base images
- For `stable`: Checks `quay.io/fedora/fedora-coreos:stable` (CoreOS does not use cosign)
- For `latest`/`beta`/`gts`: Checks `ghcr.io/ublue-os/base-main:<tag>`
- A `kernel_pin` overrides the result, taking the version from the `fcNN` portion of the kernel
- Returns the Fedora major version (e.g., 43, 44)

Do not assume the streams sit on different Fedora releases. They frequently
resolve to the same major version, so anything version-dependent must key off
the value this recipe returns rather than off the stream name.

### Containerfile Multi-Stage Build
The `Containerfile` uses a multi-stage build process:

1. **Stage `ctx`** (FROM scratch): Copies all build context (system_files, build_files, packaging, etc.)
2. **Stage `fprintd`** (FROM the same pinned silverblue-main): `build_files/shared/build-fprintd.sh` builds
   `packaging/fprintd` with rpmbuild into `/out`. Its build tools never reach the image: `base` mounts `/out`
   for `build.sh`, and `05-override-install.sh` installs fprintd and fprintd-pam from it in place of
   Fedora's, refusing a base whose fprintd is past the spec's, and puts the source package in
   `/usr/src/amethystora`
3. **Stage `apps`** (FROM the same pinned silverblue-main): `build_files/shared/build-apps.sh` installs
   Fedora's Rust, downloads the agent's embedding model (potion-base-8M, at one Hugging Face revision, each
   file checked against its SHA-256), runs the tests of every crate in `apps/` and builds the one program,
   `amethystora-sensor` and the agent's two tools into `/out`, with the licences of their crates, then clears
   its build away. `base` mounts the whole stage at `/apps-stage`:
   `13-apps.sh` installs from its `/out`, and `20-tests.sh` runs its Node. Neither Rust nor Node reaches
   the image
4. **Stage `base`** (FROM silverblue-main): Base Amethystora image
   - Mounts build context from `ctx` stage
   - Runs in three steps: `/ctx/build_files/shared/prepare.sh`, then
     `03-install-kernel-akmods.sh`, the only step the kernel module signing key (`AKMODS_PRIVKEY`,
     and for a throwaway key `AKMODS_CERT`) is mounted for, before any of the build's own
     third-party repositories is added, then `/ctx/build_files/shared/build.sh`, which runs the rest
5. **dx**: not a stage of its own. `just build amethystora-dx` passes `IMAGE_FLAVOR=dx`, and
   `build.sh` runs `build-dx.sh` inside the `base` stage once the rest has finished

**Build Arguments:**
- `AKMODS_DIGEST`, `AKMODS_ZFS_DIGEST`, `AKMODS_NVIDIA_DIGEST` - The kernel and module images, resolved to a digest and checked with cosign by the Justfile once; step 03 copies them by that digest
- `BASE_IMAGE_CREATED` - When the base image was built (seconds since the epoch), which `00-image-info.sh` writes into `image-info.json` as `base-created` for the report's image-age check
- `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` - Upstream base (silverblue/kinoite)
- `BASE_IMAGE_SHA` - Digest of the base image, resolved from `image-versions.yml`
- `FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION` - Dynamically set by Just (43/44)
- `IMAGE_NAME` - Target image name (amethystora/amethystora-dx)
- `KERNEL` - Pinned kernel version (optional)
- `UBLUE_IMAGE_TAG` - Stream tag (stable/latest/beta)

### Base Image Pinning

`image-versions.yml` is the single source of truth for pinned upstream digests,
and every entry in it is load-bearing. `just build` reads each digest with `yq`
and passes it into the Containerfile, which builds `FROM image:tag@digest`.

Base image entries are keyed by Fedora major version and must be named
`<base_image_name>-main-<fedora_version>`, for example `silverblue-main-44`.
The key is the version `just fedora_version` resolves at build time, not the
stream name, so the pinned digest can never disagree with the version the
kernel and akmods were resolved for.

At a Fedora rollover, add a new entry before building, and remove the one no
stream resolves to any more. A missing entry fails the build with `No digest
pinned for silverblue-main-<version>` rather than silently falling back to a
floating tag.

A pinned base never moves by itself, and most packages come with it.
`bump-base-images.yml` proposes the new digests daily (Renovate's
`image-versions.yml` manager does the same), `20-tests.sh` warns when the base
is more than 10 days older than the build, and the report says how old the base
of the running image is.

`repo:tag@sha256:...` is valid for buildah `FROM` and for cosign, but `skopeo
inspect` and `podman manifest inspect` both reject it with "Docker references
with both a tag and digest are currently not supported". Do not "fix" a working
`FROM` on the basis of that error.

### Publishing and Image Signing

Every tag is pushed twice. podman does not send layer annotations on the first
push unless the layers already exist in the registry, so the first push of a
rechunked image produces a different manifest digest than later pushes. Pushing
each tag once left every tag on its own digest while only one of them received
the cosign signature, the SBOM and the attestation. See
[containers/podman#27796](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27796)
and the equivalent workaround in `ublue-os/aurora`. Do not collapse the
duplicate push.

Publishing happens only from main (`PUBLISH` in `reusable-build.yml`, see
Workflow Architecture), so PR builds and dispatches from other branches validate
the image but never push. `Latest Images` publishes only on `merge_group` and
`workflow_dispatch`; there is no cron. Only `Stable Images` is scheduled
(Tuesdays 01:00 UTC). Merging directly to `main` and bypassing the merge queue
therefore publishes nothing.

### Build Script Execution Order
The build runs the scripts in `build_files/base/` in this order, which is not the numerical one:
`build_files/shared/prepare.sh` the first, `03-install-kernel-akmods.sh` as a step of its own, and
`build_files/shared/build.sh` the rest. Before the first of them, `prepare.sh` removes the base image's
`ublue-os-*` packages that `system_files` replaces, and swaps Fedora's logo and release packages for
Fedora's generic ones, as its trademark guidelines ask of a remix: `fedora-logos` for `generic-logos`,
and the `fedora-release` packages for `generic-release` in the package database only, their files
staying in place.
1. `00-image-info.sh` - Sets image metadata and os-release info, and takes Fedora's name out of the other release files (`/usr/lib/fedora-release`, the CPE, the software identification tags)
2. `03-install-kernel-akmods.sh` - Installs the kernel and the kmods beside it: v4l2loopback, xpadneo and xone from Universal Blue's `akmods` image, evdi built here, ZFS on stable, and on the NVIDIA images the driver of `akmods-nvidia-open` or `akmods-nvidia-lts` (see Drivers)
3. `04-packages.sh` - Installs Fedora and COPR packages
4. `05-override-install.sh` - Overrides base image packages. Among them the multimedia stack: the base image installs negativo17's FFmpeg, built with `--enable-nonfree` and labelled by FFmpeg itself "nonfree and unredistributable", and its `pipewire-libs-extra`, whose LC3plus plugin links `liblc3plus`, which has no licence to redistribute. Both are replaced with Fedora's `ffmpeg-free` and `fdk-aac-free`, RPM Fusion's `libavcodec-freeworld`, and RPM Fusion's aptX plugin. negativo17's repository is `fedora-multimedia` in the base image and outranks Fedora's, so `17-cleanup.sh` turns it off; do not install FFmpeg, codec or PipeWire packages from it. `20-tests.sh` fails on any FFmpeg library that reports itself unredistributable. The script also deletes `/usr/share/doc`, after moving the licence, copyright and NOTICE files that some 120 packages keep only there into `/usr/share/licenses`, and installs Starship from a pinned release checked against its published checksum (the pin is bumped by Renovate)
5. `06-branding.sh` - Puts the Amethystora artwork (generated by `node branding/generate.mjs`) where the boot menu, the boot splash, GDM and the Logo Menu look for it: the GRUB font, the Plymouth theme, Fedora's own logo files, which GDM, the Settings About page and the fallback splash look up by fixed path, and the Logo Menu's panel icon, which `07-debrand.sh` would only rename, not redraw. The Logo Menu ships a logo for every distribution and maker it knows of; the script removes them all and cuts the extension's two lists down to the Amethystora entry, index 0, which the dconf defaults select. `20-tests.sh` fails if another logo is left
6. `build_files/shared/build-gnome-extensions.sh` - Builds the GNOME Shell extensions from the git submodules
7. `10-icons.sh` - Installs the candy-icons icon theme from a pinned upstream commit (the pin is bumped by Renovate; see `.github/renovate.json5`). Apps the pack has no artwork for are aliased to its nearest icon; where nothing is near enough, the icon is drawn for this image in the pack's style and kept in `build_files/shared/candy-icons`, from where the script installs it into the theme. `NOTICE` names each of those icons with where its outline comes from and its licence, and `20-tests.sh` fails on one it does not name; an icon that reuses the pack's artwork, as the Security shield does, is GPL-3.0 like the pack, not Apache-2.0. The theme redraws nobody's logo: a logo is a trademark, and Mozilla, JetBrains, Anthropic and most others allow theirs unaltered or not at all. Of the pack's application icons only the drawings named in `build_files/shared/candy-icons/keep` stay, the pictograms of a job rather than of a product, and every application whose logo the pack redrew (Firefox, Thunderbird, the JetBrains IDEs and some 700 more) shows the icon it brought with it; the logos on the pack's folder, file type and status icons are removed too. Do not alias an application to another maker's logo, do not draw one for this image (Bazaar's is the one that is, and `NOTICE` says so: its maker publishes no trademark terms, which is what `keep` asks of a logo), and add a name to `keep` only after looking at the drawing; `20-tests.sh` fails on an application icon that is neither on the list nor drawn here. `user-setup.hooks.d/16-retire-jetbrains-icons.sh` takes back the links an earlier image made to the IDE drawings
8. `11-gtk-theme.sh` - Installs the Amethystora GTK theme: EliverLara's Sweet, by the author of candy-icons, with every cool colour in it rotated onto the amethyst palette by `build_files/shared/recolor.py`. It ships under Amethystora's own name because the palette is no longer Sweet's. Only the `amethystora` and `amethystora-light` themes name it in their `gtk.theme`; the rest stay on adw-gtk3, which follows the GNOME accent colour. libadwaita ignores `gtk-theme` and a Flatpak cannot see `/usr/share/themes` at all, so both are reached by `theme-set.hooks.d/20-gtk-apps.sh`: it mirrors the active theme into `~/.themes`, which `/etc/flatpak/overrides/global` grants every sandbox read-only, and writes the `~/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` that imports from the mirror
9. `12-login-screen.sh` - Patches the login screen background into GNOME Shell's own stylesheet. GNOME reads it from the `#lockDialogGroup` rule inside `gnome-shell-theme.gresource` and from nowhere else, so the bundle is unpacked, the rule appended and the bundle rebuilt. The picture is the crown the boot splash ends on, as sharp as the splash draws it and without the gem, drawn by `branding/generate.mjs`
10. `12-tour.sh` - Swaps the picture on GNOME Tour's first page, which Fedora builds with Fedora's logo on it, for Amethystora's, in the resource bundle the Tour reads its pictures from (`/usr/share/gnome-tour/resources.gresource`), unpacked and rebuilt as `12-login-screen.sh` does. The picture is the boot splash at the top of its glow, drawn by `branding/generate.mjs` into `/usr/share/amethystora/tour/welcome.svg`
11. `13-apps.sh` - Installs the Amethystora apps (the Manual, `Super+F1`; Security; Updates; Notes; Logs; Backups; Control): the one program the Containerfile's `apps` stage built from `apps/` (`build_files/shared/build-apps.sh`, see The Amethystora apps), hard-linked to each app's own path in `/usr/lib/amethystora-<app>`, Quicksand for the wordmark from `branding/fonts`, which the `ctx` stage copies in, and the licences of the crates built into it. It also writes the apps' launchers in the languages the apps are translated into (`translate-desktop.py`). Each app's translations stay in `system_files/shared/usr/lib/amethystora-<app>/resources/app/locale`
12. `14-security.sh` - What Amethystora Security reports on, beside its window: derives network protection's Suricata configuration (`/usr/share/amethystora/ips/suricata.yaml`) from the one the suricata package ships, with `build_files/shared/ips-config.py`, so that it fits Suricata 7 and 8 alike, and compiles `po/*.po`, the report's and the app permissions' translations, into `/usr/share/locale/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/amethystora.mo` with `msgfmt --check`
13. `07-debrand.sh` - Renames every remaining Universal Blue file, command, service and reference to Amethystora (logic in `build_files/shared/debrand.py`; `20-tests.sh` fails the build if any is left). Licence files, copyright lines and the comments that credit an author keep upstream's names
14. `08-hardening.sh` - Signature-verified updates, firewall default zone, account lockout, Parental Controls' allowed hours at the text consoles and over SSH (see Logins), kernel lockdown, and the sudo PATH that `ublue-os/main` leaves open. The polkit and udev fixes are made in the files themselves (`org.amethystora.privileged.user.setup.policy`; `50-zsa.rules`, `60-arduino-mbed.rules`, `88-neutron_hifi_dac.rules` and `92-viia.rules`, which give their devices to the user at the seat with `uaccess` instead of to every account: a keyboard's hidraw device carries every key typed on it, and `20-tests.sh` fails on a rule the image adds that gives a hidraw device or a vendor's devices to everyone). Lockdown is skipped on the NVIDIA images, whose driver is an akmods build signed with the machine owner key: forcing lockdown on a machine with Secure Boot off would leave it without a graphics driver. With Secure Boot on, Fedora's kernel locks itself down whatever the arguments say (`20-tests.sh` checks its config), so the argument only matters without; `ame security lockdown` adds or takes it off per machine. It takes setuid root off what a desktop never runs (`chfn`, `chage`, `gpasswd`, `newgrp`, `ksu`, `mount.davfs`), masks systemd's SSH-over-vsock generator in `/etc` (`ame security ssh-settings off` unmasks it) and sets BlueZ's privacy and 30-second visibility in its own `main.conf`, which reads no drop-ins (`ame security bluetooth-privacy`). The settings that are plain files live in `system_files/shared` (`usr/lib/sysctl.d`, `usr/lib/modprobe.d`, `usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d`, `etc/ssh/sshd_config.d`, `etc/security/faillock.conf`, `etc/flatpak/overrides/global`, `etc/audit/rules.d`)
15. `17-cleanup.sh` - Cleanup operations, and the systemd units the image enables, the per-user ones with `systemctl --global` (`amethystora-pkg-upgrade.timer`, `amethystora-update-alert.service`, `amethystora-dns-portal.service`). It also makes the `amepkg` link, since the build's rsync skips links in `system_files`. Two things here are deliberately *disabled*: `input-remapper.service`, which runs as root and reads every input device, and `usbguard.service`, which would block the keyboard on a machine where nobody had allowed it yet. Both are turned on per machine by an `ame security` command (`usb`, `input-remapper`). So are `waydroid-container.service` and `scx_loader.service` (`ame apps android`, `ame system scheduler`). `usbguard-dbus.service` is *masked*, not disabled, since D-Bus activation would start it and GNOME's USB protection plugin would then allow every new device while the screen is unlocked: only `ame security usb locked` unmasks it. It enables `fwupd-refresh.timer`, which Fedora leaves to GNOME Software, the pools of disks' `amethystora-raid-check.timer`, `amethystora-raid-scrub.timer`, `amethystora-raid-boot.service` and `amethystora-raid-mirror.service`, and `clamd@scan.socket` with `amethystora-clamd-idle.timer` in place of clamd itself
16. `18-workarounds.sh` - Temporary fixes/workarounds
17. `19-initramfs.sh` - Regenerates initramfs, adding dracut's `tpm2-tss` module where dracut has it so that `ame security disk-unlock` can hand the disk key to the TPM, and without what changes with every build, so that two builds of the same packages make the same initramfs and an update between them can finish with a soft reboot (see The Updates app)
18. `build_files/shared/build-dx.sh` - dx only: copies `system_files/dx`, runs `build_files/dx/00-dx.sh` and then `01-tests-dx.sh`
18a. `build_files/shared/build-agent-index.sh` - The AI agent's index (`amethystora-agent-tools index --write`), once every name is final and every unit enabled or not, of the image as it then is, dx's files included (see Agentic features)
19. `build_files/shared/source-manifest.sh` - Writes `/usr/share/licenses/amethystora/SOURCES`: every package with its licence, source package and where that source is, which the GPL asks for and the written offer in `NOTICE` points to. Fedora keeps its own in Koji. RPM Fusion, negativo17 and Copr publish only their current builds, so the script fetches the source packages of theirs that are under a licence asking for the source into `/usr/src/amethystora`, and the build fails when one cannot be fetched; a Copr project the image starts installing from goes in its `COPR_PROJECTS`. NVIDIA's own repository, which the NVIDIA images take the container toolkit from, publishes no source packages at all, so its packages are listed with the address of their source instead (`NO_SOURCE_PACKAGES`); a GPL package from any other maker the script does not know still fails the build. `20-tests.sh` fails if a package is missing from the list or a source package from the image
20. `20-tests.sh` - Runs last, after the repositories are validated and the build cleaned up; fails the build on anything missing or left behind, including a GNOME Shell extension shipped without its licence

The sealed images then run `build_files/sealed/` from `Containerfile.sealed`, on the finished image (see Sealed images).

## Development Guidelines

### Making Changes
1. **ALWAYS validate first:** `just check && pre-commit run --all-files`
2. **Make minimal modifications** - prefer configuration over code changes
3. **Test formatting:** `just fix` to auto-format
4. **Avoid full container builds** unless specifically testing container changes, or asked to run the tests
   (`tests/vm`, the `run-tests` skill)
5. **Focus on system_files/ changes** for most user-facing modifications

### File Editing Best Practices
- **JSON files**: Validate syntax with `pre-commit run check-json`
- **YAML files**: Validate syntax with `pre-commit run check-yaml`
- **Justfile**: Always run `just check` after modifications
- **Shell scripts**: Follow existing patterns in build_files/

### Common Modification Patterns
- **Adding packages**: Edit `build_files/base/04-packages.sh`, add to appropriate array
- **System configuration**: Modify files in `system_files/shared/`
- **Build logic**: Edit scripts in `build_files/base/` or `build_files/dx/`
- **CI/CD**: Modify workflows in `.github/workflows/`

## Trust These Instructions

**The information in this document has been validated against the current repository state.** Only search for additional information if:
- Instructions are incomplete for your specific task
- You encounter errors not covered in the workarounds section
- Repository structure has changed significantly

This repository is complex but well-structured. Following these instructions will significantly reduce build failures and exploration time.

## Dependency Updates (Renovate)

Renovate is configured in `.github/renovate.json5` and tracks its work on the
Dependency Dashboard, issue #2680.

Never hand-edit a `renovate/*` branch and never merge `main` into one. Renovate
will not update or replace a branch it no longer owns; the PR moves to "PR
Edited (Blocked)" on the dashboard and that dependency silently stops updating.
Nothing about the PR looks wrong from the outside, so this is only visible on
the dashboard. `rebaseWhen` is set to `behind-base-branch` so Renovate keeps its
own branches current and there is no reason to touch them by hand.

Closing a Renovate PR is not a fix either. It moves the entry to "PR Closed
(Blocked)" and Renovate stops recreating it. Only close one once the dependency
has actually been updated by other means, and say so in the closing comment.

Renovate PRs are authored by `app/ubot-7274`, not `app/renovate`. Filtering by
the latter silently returns nothing.

## Other Rules that are Important to the Maintainers

- Ensure that [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) are used and enforced for every commit and pull request title.
- Always be surgical with the least amount of code, the project strives to be easy to maintain.
- This project is published at iarsslen/amethystora
- The desktop layer is maintained here, in `system_files/shared`; it is not pulled from upstream
