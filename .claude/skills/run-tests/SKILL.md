# Running the tests and fixing what fails

A run builds the whole image from the last commit (`just build`), installs it onto a disk, boots it with
Secure Boot and a TPM in the VM lab (`tests/vm`), and runs the suites in `tests/vm/suites` in it. It takes
an hour or more, so start one only when the user asks. The maintainer's rules for it (2026-10-11):

- A run builds **committed HEAD**, never the working tree.
- **As few build and test round trips as possible** (the maintainer's rule of 2026-10-29). While iterating, run
  only **the suites of the current work** (its own suites and those of the areas it changed: `run.sh test --keep
  --suites NN,NN`), never all of them. Fix every failure **live in the kept VM**, without rebuilding it, until
  the issue is really gone (read the log and the screenshot, not only the count); rerun the suite once more to
  be sure it is stable. Then carry the fixes back here, commit them, and make **one final build** with all of
  them. On that build, run **the full suite only when the changes are risky** (packages, the build, boot,
  security, PAM, the kernel, the image's units, or a shared library many suites use); otherwise a final test of
  the current work's suites only. Every bug a run finds is fixed, not only reported. How:
  [live-fix.md](live-fix.md).
- When a local build cannot run, a **GitHub** build on a test branch takes its place.

How to read a failure, try a fix without a full rebuild, and tell the lab's problems from the image's:
[diagnosing.md](diagnosing.md). How the lab works: `tests/vm/README.md`.

## 1. Before the run

1. `git status`: commit your own finished work first, staging your files by name. Other sessions work in
   this tree; their uncommitted files stay out of the run and out of your commits.
2. On Windows, Docker Desktop's CLI is not on PATH in the Bash tool:
   `export PATH="$(cygpath -u "$LOCALAPPDATA")/Programs/DockerDesktop/resources/bin:$PATH"`, and
   `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` before any `docker exec` that names a path inside the lab.
3. Nothing else to prepare: `run.sh` starts the lab container (`amevm`) when it is stopped, loads KVM when
   Docker lost it, and brings the lab's code up to date from the commit. Only a change to
   `tests/vm/Containerfile` needs `bash tests/vm/setup.sh` first.

## 2. Run

```bash
bash tests/vm/run.sh >SCRATCHPAD/run.log 2>&1     # build, disk, test
```

Start it with `run_in_background: true` and the longest timeout (2 hours); you are told when it ends. Do not
pipe it into `tail`: that hides its exit status. The run carries on inside the lab even if the command is
cut off, and writes as it goes:

```bash
docker exec amevm cat /vm/runs/last/run.log       # one line per stage and per suite
docker exec amevm cat /vm/runs/last/summary.md    # at the end: stages, suites, every "not ok"
```

To follow it, wait in the background for a line, never with a chain of `sleep`s:

```bash
until docker exec amevm grep -q "== build: \(passed\|FAILED\)" /vm/runs/last/run.log; do sleep 30; done
```

`run.sh build`, `run.sh disk` and `run.sh test` run one stage from what the last run left; `test --keep`
leaves VM `test` running afterwards for the `amethystora-vm` MCP tools. Careful: after a failed build,
`run.sh test` boots the **previous** disk, not your change.

## 3. When something fails

Work through [diagnosing.md](diagnosing.md):

1. Find the first real error: the build's failing script and command, or the suite's `not ok` with its
   indented reasons, its log, its screenshot and the guest's journal.
2. Decide whether the lab or the image is wrong. A check that is itself wrong is fixed in the suite.
3. Fix it live in the kept VM ([live-fix.md](live-fix.md)): put the changed file into the running guest,
   reload what reads it, rerun that suite or step, and repeat until it passes there. Only what cannot be
   changed in a running machine (the kernel, the initramfs, a package, `20-tests.sh` itself) waits for the
   final run; check such a fix in a container of the image first.
4. Fix it at its cause, in the fewest lines. Never weaken, skip or delete a check to get a pass.
5. Commit it: `fix(scope): what was wrong`, a body saying what the run found, and the footer
   `Assisted-by: <model> via Claude Code` (no Co-Authored-By line). One commit per cause.
6. Add the check that would have caught it, if nothing did: `20-tests.sh` for what is true of the image
   as built, `tests/vm/suites` for what has to happen on a running machine.
7. When every failure is fixed, validated live and stable on a second pass, one final build of the commits,
   then the full suite if the changes are risky (see the rule above), else the current work's suites only.

**Code that is not yours.** Committed code from another session is part of HEAD, and fixing it is part of
the run. But a file with uncommitted changes in `git status` is being edited right now: report the failure
instead of editing it.

**What needs the user.** A design choice, a secret, a decision between two behaviours, a change upstream,
or anything the fix would take away from a user: stop on it, report it with the evidence, and go on with
the rest.

**When to stop.** Three final runs, or three attempts at the same build error, then report.
If the build cannot run here at all, go to section 5.

## 4. Report

- The summary table: each stage with its time, each suite with its counts.
- The commits the run made, one line each, and what each fixed.
- Measurements the suites printed (lines starting with `#`, such as Falco's memory).
- What is left, why, and what it needs from the user.
- The run's folder in the lab (`/vm/runs/<when>`), for the screenshots and logs.

## 5. GitHub instead of a local build

Only when the build cannot run here (out of disk: `docker system df`; out of memory; a registry that does not
answer). Never push to `main`; `gh` is logged in as the maintainer, and git pushes over SSH.

```bash
sha=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
git push origin "HEAD:refs/heads/test/${sha}"
gh workflow run "Latest Images" --repo iarsslen/amethystora --ref "test/${sha}"
gh run list --repo iarsslen/amethystora --workflow "Latest Images" --branch "test/${sha}" --limit 1
gh run watch RUN_ID --repo iarsslen/amethystora --exit-status
gh run view RUN_ID --repo iarsslen/amethystora --log-failed | tail -n 200
git push origin --delete "test/${sha}"     # when done
```

A branch build publishes nothing (`PUBLISH` in `reusable-build.yml`): it checks the build and `20-tests.sh`
only. The VM suites then wait for a local build, or for the image `main` publishes after the user pushes
(tag it `localhost/amethystora:latest` in the lab, then `run.sh disk` and `run.sh test`).

## Keeping the suites growing

A new feature gets its check in `tests/vm/suites` with it, and a bug a run found gets the check that would have
caught it. A suite is `NN-name.sh`, TAP lines from `lib.sh`'s helpers, ending with `finish`; exit 100 reboots
and runs it again with `SUITE_PHASE` one higher (`tests/vm/README.md`). A change to the lab or a suite is
tested by the next run once committed.
