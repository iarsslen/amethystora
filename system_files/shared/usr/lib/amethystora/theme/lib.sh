# Shared helpers for amethystora-theme and amethystora-menu.
#
# A theme is a directory of small files, so that adding one needs no code:
#
#   colors.toml   the palette: accent, foreground, background, cursor, selection_*, color0..color15
#   accent.theme  the GNOME accent name to pair with it (blue teal green yellow orange red pink
#                 purple slate); without it the palette's accent is matched to the closest one
#   light.mode    present when the theme is light
#
# colors.toml may also carry success, warning and error, for a theme whose palette slots color2, color3 and color1 are
# not a green, a yellow and a red (Matte Black's, Rose Pine Dawn's): the interface's status colours come from them.
#   pair.theme    the name of the light or dark theme this one flips to on Super+Ctrl+D
#   gtk.theme     a GTK theme name, when adw-gtk3 is not wanted
#   icons.theme   an icon theme name, when the image's own is not wanted (Glass, or Glass for light for a light theme)
#   style.theme   the desktop style: one of STYLES below, the shape of the top bar, menus, notifications,
#                 dialogs, buttons and windows (floating when the theme names none)
#   font.theme    the interface font's family, when the desktop's own (Adwaita Sans) is not wanted
#   mono.theme    the monospace font's family (terminals, code, Text Editor), when JetBrains Mono is not wanted
#   cursor.theme  a cursor theme name, when the desktop's own is not wanted
#   vscode.theme  the VSCodium colour theme to select
#   backgrounds.list  wallpapers elsewhere on the system, one path per line; the first is the one
#                 the theme opens on. Every shipped theme lists its pictures here.
#   backgrounds/  wallpapers to cycle with Super+Ctrl+Space
#
# Themes ship read-only in /usr/share/amethystora/themes. A directory of the same name in
# ~/.config/amethystora/themes is copied over the top, so a theme can be tweaked file by file, and
# a directory that exists only there is a theme of the user's own.
#
# Applying a theme renders /usr/share/amethystora/themed/*.tpl against colors.toml and swaps the
# result into ~/.config/amethystora/current/theme. Everything downstream reads that one path, so
# nothing else has to know which theme is current.
