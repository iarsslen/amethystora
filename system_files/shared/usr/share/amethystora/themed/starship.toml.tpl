# Rendered from the current Amethystora theme. Drop a starship.toml of your own into the theme

# A powerline prompt: user@host, the folder and, in a git repository, its branch, each on a
# background of the theme's colours, then the command on a line of its own. The arrows are
# Nerd Fonts' (U+E0B0), which the image ships. Inside a repository the folder's own format
# (repo_root_format) carries the arrow that leads into the branch, and the branch's group ends the
# line with one, so that no arrow is left pointing at nothing.
