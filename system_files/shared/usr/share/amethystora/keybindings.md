# Hotkeys

Amethystora is built to be driven from the keyboard. `Super` is the key with the Windows or Command
logo on it. This list is also what `ame desktop keybindings` shows, and the Amethystora menu
(`Super+Alt+Space`) reaches most of what these keys do.

## Tiling

The tiling puts the windows of a workspace side by side on a strip that scrolls to keep the focused one
in view. `Super` and an arrow moves between windows, adding `Ctrl` moves the window itself, adding
`Shift` goes to another monitor. These keys, and the monitor keys under Workspaces, are the tiling
layout's; the classic layout (`ame desktop layout classic`) has GNOME's own.

## The desktop

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Super+V` | Notifications and the calendar |
| `Super+Shift+V` | The clipboard history |
| `Super+L` | Lock the screen |
| `Super+D` | Show the desktop |

In every Amethystora app (Security, Updates, Logs, Notes, Backups, Control and this manual), `Ctrl+=`,
`Ctrl+-` and `Ctrl+0` change the size of everything in the window, and in all but this manual `Ctrl+R`
or `F5` reads it all again. Starting one that is open already brings its window forward, at the page
asked for.
