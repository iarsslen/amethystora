# Files' scripts menu: Folder colour (the six colours and No colour), Back in time and Copy without hidden data, in the
# account's language, as tiny scripts in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts that hand Files' arguments to
# /usr/libexec/amethystora-folder-colour, /usr/libexec/amethystora-back-in-time and /usr/libexec/amethystora-clean-copy.
# Files shows them under Scripts in the menu of a selection.
#
# Each file carries a marker in its second line, and only such a file is ever written over: a script of the person's
# own under the same name stays, and that entry is not written. What was written is listed in
# ~/.local/state/amethystora/files-menu.json, so that a later version can replace or take away exactly those, whatever
# the language since. Once: an entry the person deletes does not come back until the version is raised.
