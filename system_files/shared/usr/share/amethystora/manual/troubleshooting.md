# Troubleshooting

Most problems on an image-based system have the same three answers: find out what happened, roll
back if an update caused it, and report it so the next image fixes it.

## Let the agent look first

With the [AI agent](ai-agent.md) on (`ame agent toggle on`), **Diagnose a problem** in the Amethystora
menu (`Super+Alt+Space`), or from a terminal:

```bash
amethystora-agent diagnose "the second monitor stays black after suspend"
```

It reads the logs and crash reports, changes nothing, and comes back with the cause and a fix to
consider. [The AI agent](ai-agent.md#diagnose-a-problem) has more.

## The logs

Open **Logs** from the app grid, or run `amethystora-logs`. It opens on **Important**, the errors
from everything on the machine since it started. The sidebar splits the rest into your session, the
system, the kernel and hardware, security (sign-ins, `sudo`, what the audit rules or the file-watch
sensor caught) and **Crashes**, each with a count of what is new since the last boot where it matters.

- **Search** looks through what the messages say, as you type. The `.*` button beside it takes the
  search as a regular expression instead.
- **Time** goes back to the previous boot, any boot the journal still keeps, the last hour, day or
  week, or everything. **Level** hides what is less serious than you pick.
- **Apps and services** lists everything that has written to the journal. Pick an app to read what it
  said each time it ran, or a service of the system or of your session.
- Click an entry to read all of it, with every field the journal keeps. **Only …** narrows the view to
  where it came from, and **Around this** shows everything logged in the minute before and after it.
- **Follow** adds new entries as they are written. **Export** saves what is shown to a text or JSON
  file, and the terminal button opens the same view in `journalctl`. The command for the view is also
  at the bottom of the sidebar.

Administrators, the accounts in `wheel`, see everything. Any other account sees its own session and
apps only, and the views of the system say so.

The same in a terminal:

| Command | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `journalctl -b -p warning` | Warnings and errors since this boot |
| `journalctl -b -1 -p warning` | The same for the previous boot, after a crash or a freeze |
| `journalctl --user -b` | Your own session: the desktop, your apps |
| `systemctl --failed` | Services that failed to start |
| `coredumpctl list` | Programs that crashed |
| `ame system logs-this-boot` | Everything from this boot |
| `ame system local-overrides` | The files in `/etc` you, or something you ran, have changed |

## An update broke something

Pick the previous system at the boot menu to confirm it was the update. System Updates then offers to
keep it, which `sudo bootc rollback` does too, until a fixed image is out. [Updates](updates.md#rolling-back).

## Common problems

### A package I layered is gone

It was layered with `rpm-ostree install`, and the machine was then switched with `bootc switch`,
which builds the new system from the image alone. Install it again, and switch images or streams with
`rpm-ostree rebase` from now on ([Installing software](software.md#layering-the-last-resort)).

### An app cannot see a folder, a device, or will not open at all

Flatpak apps only reach what they are allowed to, and on Amethystora that excludes X11 and input
devices. Open **Flatseal**, pick the app, and grant what it needs: a folder under **Filesystem**, or
**X11 windowing system** for an app that does not speak Wayland.

### An extension misbehaves, or the desktop looks wrong

Turn the extension off in **Extension Manager**, then log out and back in. If the desktop still
misbehaves, put your account's settings back as the image ships them:

```bash
ame system reset-settings account
```

That resets the dock, your custom hotkeys, your extension choices and the theme, and keeps your
language, keyboard and accessibility settings. It saves them first, so `ame system reset-settings undo`
brings them back ([Resetting settings](#resetting-settings)).

### `Super+Ctrl+Space` changes nothing

It moves to the next wallpaper of the current theme. A theme of your own with a single picture has
nothing to move to, and a notification says so: add more ([Themes](themes.md#wallpapers)). The theme
picker is `Super+Ctrl+Shift+Space`.

### The account is locked after wrong passwords

Ten wrong passwords lock the account for ten minutes. Wait, or unlock it from another administrator
account with `sudo faillock --user <name> --reset`.

### A DisplayLink dock shows nothing

With Secure Boot on, its driver loads only once Amethystora's key is enrolled:
`ame security secure-boot`, then restart ([Hardware](hardware.md#secure-boot)).

### Switching keyboard layouts

`Super+Space` is search here, so the next keyboard layout is on `Super+Shift+Space`. Add layouts in
**Settings → Keyboard**.

### The disk is filling up

```bash
ame system clean
```

Removes unused containers, images and Flatpak runtimes. `flatpak uninstall --unused` and
`podman system prune` do parts of the same by hand.

### A disk of a pool failed

The notification names the pool and the disk, and says whether every file is still there. **Open
Control**, or run `ame system raid`, and replace the disk with a spare one at least as large; a pool
that did not open at all can be opened with a disk missing first. [When a disk fails](hardware.md#when-a-disk-fails)
explains each step. For the reason, `journalctl -k -g btrfs` shows what the kernel said about the
disk, and `ame system raid status` what each disk is counting.

### The machine waits at the start with a disk dead

A system on two disks waits for both at the start, with no end, when one has died: the screen stays
on the boot logo, or on "A start job is running for /dev/disk/by-uuid/…". Turn the machine off and on
again and choose **Start with a disk missing** in the boot menu, then replace the disk
([The system's own disks](hardware.md#the-systems-own-disks)).

### Resetting settings

When settings, not files, are what went wrong, put them back as the image ships them and keep
everything else:

```bash
ame system reset-settings
```

It asks which:

- **Your account**: the desktop's settings, the dock, hotkeys, extensions, theme and window layout,
  and what apps keep in GNOME's settings. Your language, keyboard and accessibility settings stay.
  Extensions you installed stay installed, and are off until you turn them on again. No password.
- **This machine**: every file in `/etc` that differs from the image's own copy in `/usr/etc`, for every
  account. It shows each file first, then asks for an administrator's password. Services you turned on are off again, and the image's own ones you turned
  off are on. What the machine knows stays as it is: the accounts and how they log in, its disks, name,
  networks and printers, its language, time and keyboard, what it trusts, its hardware and virtual
  machines, and every setting [Security](security.md) makes, whose report says when one of those
  changed. Restart afterwards.
- **Both**.

Your files, apps and containers stay either way. What a reset replaced is saved first, your account's in
`~/.local/state/amethystora/reset-settings` and the machine's in `/var/lib/amethystora/reset-settings`,
and **Undo** brings the last one back: `ame system reset-settings undo`. **Reset settings** on
[Control](control.md)'s **System** page opens the same command.

### Starting over

When a machine has collected more changes than are worth undoing one by one, and
[resetting the settings](#resetting-settings) was not enough, it can start again as a new installation
of the image it runs:

```bash
ame system powerwash
```

It asks twice, then makes a new installation beside the current one, which starts at the next
restart: the image's own settings in `/etc`, an empty `/var`, and no accounts, home folders or settings
of yours. Nothing is erased. The old system stays on the disk, taking up its space, and the boot menu
can still start it, so nothing is lost if you change your mind; getting rid of it for good is a job
for an administrator in a terminal. It is experimental, and not offered on a [sealed](updates.md#sealed-images)
machine. To give a machine away, install it again from the ISO instead, which erases the disk.
**Start over** on [Control](control.md)'s **System** page opens the same command.

## Reporting a problem

Report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/iarsslen/amethystora/issues), and ask questions in the
[discussions](https://github.com/iarsslen/amethystora/discussions). `ame report` gathers what a
report needs into a file in your home folder (the image, your groups, failed services and the errors
logged since this boot), shows you all of it, and then, if you say so, opens a new issue with all but
the errors filled in. Nothing is posted until you submit it; drag the file in if the errors help.
Otherwise, include:

- the output of `rpm-ostree status`, which names the exact image,
- what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead,
- the relevant lines from the logs above,
- whether the previous image had the same problem.
