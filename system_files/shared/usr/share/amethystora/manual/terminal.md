# The terminal

Amethystora is made for people who like the command line as much as for people who never open it.
When you do, it is ready for you.

## Opening one

The keyboard shortcut `Super+Return` opens a terminal, and so do `Ctrl+Alt+T` and `Ctrl+Alt+Return`, the
shortcuts most Linux desktops use ([Hotkeys](../keybindings.md#launching)). The terminal is
kitty, a fast terminal that draws on the graphics card. Its settings are the image's, in
`/etc/xdg/kitty/kitty.conf`: put a line of your own in `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` and yours wins, the rest
stays as the image has it. Ptyxis is still installed: it is the one with a menu that opens a tab inside any of your
[Distrobox and Toolbox containers](software.md#containers), and the second choice when kitty is missing.

Its colours follow the [theme](themes.md), open windows included when you switch, and so does the prompt: your
name and machine, the folder, and in a git repository its branch, each on a background of the theme's
colours, then the command on a line of its own. The arrows and icons are Nerd Fonts symbols, which kitty carries
and Ptyxis finds among the image's fonts.

## The greeting

The first terminal you open in a session says hello with the Amethystora logo, a summary of the machine,
the image you are running, a few useful commands and a tip; the ones after it just say welcome, so they
open sooner. `ame desktop greeting off` turns it off, `on` brings it back, without either it switches,
and so does the switch on [Control](control.md)'s **Desktop** page.

`fetch` shows the logo and the system summary again whenever you like. A glint crosses the logo's
facets before the summary appears; you get the still logo instead over SSH, in the text console, in a
terminal without full colour, with `NO_COLOR` set, or when **Reduce Animation** is on in
**Settings → Accessibility**. Anything you add after `fetch` goes to fastfetch, which it runs.
`fastfetch` itself, and `neofetch`, show the same summary beside a logo picked at random, as
`/etc/amethystora/fastfetch.json` says.

The image's name in the summary ends with a lock. Closed, 🔐, this machine takes only updates signed
with Amethystora's key; open and blinking, 🔓, it takes its updates unchecked, and `ame system rebase`
switches it back ([Signed updates](updates.md#signed-updates)).

## Shells

The shell is bash, with the Starship prompt. fish and zsh are installed too. The way to switch is in
the terminal rather than system-wide, so that a broken shell configuration can never lock you out of
logging in:

1. Open the terminal's **Preferences** and edit your profile.
2. Turn on **Use Custom Command** and enter `/usr/bin/fish` or `/usr/bin/zsh`.

## ame

`ame` runs the commands that come with the system: small, tested scripts for the jobs that would
otherwise take a web search, in groups such as `desktop`, `security` and `system`. This manual
mentions them where they help; to see all of them:

```bash
ame                           # the groups, and the commands outside them
ame security                  # the commands in one group, with a line about what each does
ame --list --list-submodules  # every command, in every group
ame -n security status        # print what a command would run, without running it
```

`ame pkg` is [amethystora-pkg](software.md#packages-from-other-distributions). `ujust`, the older
name of `ame`, runs the same commands, and their names from before they were grouped, such as
`ujust setup-backup`, still work.

The commands are `just` recipes, and `just` itself is yours for your own projects: a `justfile` in any
folder turns its commands into recipes the same way.

## Command line tools

Command line tools come from Homebrew, which installs into your home without `sudo` and without
touching the system:

```bash
brew install ripgrep
brew search <name>
brew upgrade
```

Browse what there is at [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh). Homebrew is updated along with
the system. Never run it with `sudo`: it is yours, not root's.

Already on the image: `just`, `gum`, `glow`, `tmux`, `fastfetch`, `git` and the rest of the usual
tools, and `open`, which opens a file or a link in its app, as on a Mac. With RamaLama installed from
Homebrew, `rl` runs it. The fonts include Inter, JetBrains Mono and the Nerd Fonts symbols, so prompts and file
managers in the terminal draw their icons.

`ame apps cli` installs a set of newer tools from Homebrew, eza, bat, ripgrep, zoxide and more, and
sets your shell up to use them in place of the usual ones: `ls` lists with eza, `cat` shows with bat,
`grep` searches with ugrep. It also installs direnv, mise, atuin, gh and more, and the Rust versions of
the core tools (`cp`, `mv`, `find`, `diff` and the rest), which then come first in your account's
`PATH`; uninstalling `uutils-coreutils` puts the system's own back. `ame desktop bling off` takes that out of your shell's settings, and `on`
puts it back; the **Terminal tools** switch on Control's **Desktop** page does the same.
