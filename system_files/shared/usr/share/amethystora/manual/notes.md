# Notes and tasks

**Notes** in the app grid keeps your notes and your to-do lists in one window. Everything stays on
this computer. Nothing is synced, and the app never connects to the internet. It takes the place of
Joplin and Planify, and brings in what you already have in them (see
[Coming from Joplin or Planify](#coming-from-joplin-or-planify)).

The first time you open it, it offers to encrypt your notes with a passphrase. That is the choice it
recommends, and the rest of this page assumes you took it.

## Notes

Notes are written in Markdown and sit in notebooks, which can hold other notebooks: the **+** beside
**Notebooks** makes one, and a notebook's **More** menu adds a note or a notebook inside it, renames it,
moves it to the top level, or deletes it, which sends its notes to the trash. The editor shows the text
and the formatted note side by side, or one above the other in a narrow window. **Ctrl+E**, or the three
buttons at the top of the note, switch between the text, both, and the formatted note alone. The sort
button over the list orders the notes by when they last changed, when they were made, or by title.

The toolbar above the text makes a selection bold or italic, a heading, a list, a checklist, a quote,
code or a link, and takes a heading or list off again. `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` indent and outdent, and
`Enter` carries a list on, or ends it on an empty item. Links to web pages and mail addresses open in
their apps.

- **Checklists:** `- [ ] like this`. Tick the boxes in the formatted note.
- **Attachments:** paste an image, drop a file on the note, or use the paperclip, up to 200 MB each.
  Pictures show in the note, from attachments only, never from a file elsewhere on the computer. Click
  any other attachment to save a copy, which is not encrypted.
- **Tags:** type in the tag row under the title and press **Enter** or a comma; it offers the tags
  you have, and `Backspace` in the empty row takes the last one off. Tags are listed in the sidebar,
  where a tag's **More** menu renames it or takes it off every note.
- **Moving a note:** pick another notebook at the top of the note, or drag the note onto a notebook
  in the sidebar.
- **Earlier versions:** the clock at the top of a note. A version is kept each time you come back to
  change a note after ten minutes away from it, up to the last 30. Restoring one keeps the text it
  replaces as a version too.
- **Trash:** **Move to the trash**, in a note's **⋯** menu, can be undone at once. In the trash a note
  can be restored or deleted for good, with its earlier versions and attachments, and **Empty** deletes
  them all. Nothing leaves the trash by itself.
- **PDF:** the **⋯** menu of a note exports it as a PDF, with its pictures.

## Tasks

**Tasks** at the top of the sidebar switches to your to-do lists, with the number due today or
overdue; `amethystora-notes tasks`, or **Tasks** in the right-click menu of Notes, opens them
straight away:

| View | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| Inbox | Tasks that are not in a project |
| Today | What is due today, and anything overdue |
| Upcoming | The week ahead, day by day, and everything after it |
| Pinned | The tasks you pinned |
| Completed | What you finished, most recent first |

Projects group tasks and can be divided into sections. Labels cut across projects. The **+** beside
**Projects** or **Labels** makes one, and its **More** menu renames it, gives it a colour, adds a section
to a project, or deletes it. **Deleting a project deletes its tasks**; deleting a section leaves its
tasks in the project, and deleting a label only takes it off its tasks. Click a task to move it to
another project or section, set its date and time, repeat, reminder, priority, labels and notes, add
subtasks, pin it, or delete it, which can be undone at once. Completing a task completes its subtasks
too, and a project folds its completed tasks away.

The **Add a task** field understands a little plain language. It takes these out of the title:

| Type | For |
| --- | --- |
| `today`, `tonight`, `tomorrow` (`tmr`), `friday` or `on fri`, `next week` (next Monday), `2026-10-31` | The date |
| `5pm`, `at 17:30` | The time, with a reminder at that time; on today, or tomorrow once it has passed, when no date is given |
| `every day`, `every 2 weeks`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` | A task that repeats |
| `p1` to `p4` | The priority, `p1` the highest |
| `@errand` | A label, made if it is new |
| `#Garden` | A project that exists, its name typed without spaces (`#GardenWork`) |

Completing a repeating task moves it to its next date. The words are English whatever the language of
the window.

### Reminders

A task with a time can remind you, from **At the time** to **1 day before**. Reminders appear as
notifications while Notes is running, and clicking one opens the task. When you close the window, Notes keeps running in the background
until the reminders still to come have gone off. **Keep running for reminders**, in **Settings**, turns
that off. Your notes are
locked while it runs like that; only the titles and times of the reminders are kept, in memory.

## Encryption

With encryption on, your notes, tasks and attachments are written to disk encrypted with AES-256-GCM,
under a random key that only your passphrase, or a [passkey](#passkeys) you add, can open. The
passphrase is stretched with scrypt, which costs 128 MiB of memory for every guess, so trying
passphrases one after another is slow.

It stays secure against quantum computers. What a quantum computer breaks is public-key cryptography
(RSA, elliptic curves), and none is used here. Against a cipher like AES, the best a quantum computer
can do is halve the key length. That leaves AES-256 at 128-bit strength, which is why AES-256 is what
NIST and the NSA's CNSA 2.0 keep for the years after quantum computers.

> **Nobody can recover a forgotten passphrase.** Not Amethystora, not an administrator, not anyone.
> Keep it somewhere safe, and keep a [backup](#backing-up).

Your notes lock:

- after 10 minutes without using Notes, or 5, 15 or 30 minutes, an hour, or only on the other two
  (**Settings**, **Lock when away**),
- when the screen locks, the computer sleeps, or the window closes,
- when you press **Ctrl+L** or **Lock** in the sidebar.

A passphrase needs at least 8 characters, typed twice. **Settings** also changes it, and turns
encryption off or on again. Changing the
passphrase changes the key too, unless you turn **Change the key as well** off: everything is
encrypted anew, so that an older copy of the notes folder, from a snapshot or a backup, cannot open
what you write from now on with the old passphrase. That older copy itself still opens with it.
Passkeys have to be added again after a new key.

While your notes are encrypted, Notes reads only encrypted files: notes or an attachment put in the
folder unencrypted are not read.

### Passkeys

A FIDO2 security key (YubiKey, Thetis, or a fingerprint model such as the YubiKey Bio) can open your
notes, so that you need not type the passphrase each time. The passphrase keeps working, and it is
what opens your notes if the key is lost: a passkey is a second way in, never the only one.

To add one, plug the key in, open **Settings** and choose **Add a passkey**. Enter your passphrase and
the PIN of the key, or leave the PIN empty for a key that reads your fingerprint. The key blinks twice;
touch it each time. From then on the lock screen offers **Open with a passkey**, which asks for the
key's PIN, or your fingerprint, and a touch. Have only that key plugged in.

- **The key needs a PIN**, and a fingerprint model an enrolled finger. Set them in Firefox at
  `about:webauthn`. A touch alone never opens your notes: someone who finds the key cannot use it
  without the PIN or your finger, and the key blocks its PIN after eight wrong tries.
- **The key has to support FIDO2's `credProtect`**, with which Notes tells it to refuse the passkey
  without the PIN or a fingerprint. Notes says so when a key does not. A passkey added before Notes
  asked for it is marked in **Settings**: remove it and add it again.
- **Add a second key as a spare**, one at a time. Each is listed in **Settings**, where **Remove**
  stops it opening your notes.
- **If a key is lost**, remove it, then change the passphrase with **Change the key as well** on.
  Someone who holds the key, knows its PIN and has an older copy of your notes folder could otherwise
  open your notes with it. Add the keys you still have again afterwards.
- A [backup](#backing-up) always asks for the passphrase: passkeys are not part of it.

The key keeps nothing of your notes. It holds a secret that never leaves it, and with the PIN or
fingerprint checked it computes a value (HMAC-SHA256, FIDO2's `hmac-secret`) under which a second
copy of your notes' key is encrypted. What is on disk is still encrypted with AES-256 only.

## Backing up

Since nothing is synced, keep a copy somewhere else. In **Settings**:

- **Back up to a file** writes one `.amnotes` file with everything in it, attachments included,
  encrypted if your notes are. It opens with the passphrase you had when you made it, on any computer:
  choose it under **Import**, which adds what is in it to the notes already there.
- **Export as Markdown** writes every note as a Markdown file in a folder per notebook, its attachments
  beside them, and the inbox and every project as a checklist. These files are **not** encrypted.

Your notes themselves are in `~/.local/share/amethystora-notes`.

## Coming from Joplin or Planify

Open **Settings** and use **Import**. Importing the same file again updates what came from it rather
than adding it twice.

- **Joplin:** in Joplin, choose **File**, **Export all**, **JEX**. Import the `.jex` file.
  Notebooks, notes, tags and attachments come across. Joplin's to-dos become tasks in the inbox.
- **Planify:** in Planify, open **Preferences**, **Backup**, and create a backup. Import its `.json`
  file from `~/.var/app/io.github.alainm23.planify/data/io.github.alainm23.planify/backups`. Projects,
  sections, tasks, subtasks, labels, dates and repeats come across.
- **Markdown files** go into a notebook called **Imported**.

Once everything is across, you can remove the old apps in Bazaar, or with
`flatpak uninstall net.cozic.joplin_desktop io.github.alainm23.planify`.
