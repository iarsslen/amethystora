# The AI agent

The AI agent is off until you turn it on: in [Control](control.md)'s **AI agent** page, or with
`ame agent toggle on`. Until then nothing on this page is there: no hotkey, no menu entries, no
**Ask the agent** buttons, and no agent is told anything about this system.

Once it is on, `Super+Ctrl+Shift+A` opens an AI agent in a terminal: the one you chose, else the first one already installed, else Claude Code. You can choose Opencode, Codex,
Antigravity CLI, Copilot CLI or Cursor CLI if you prefer. It comes with a skill that explains this system
to it, so it knows which files belong to the image and which are yours to change, how themes and
hotkeys work, how software is installed on an image-based system, and what to ask you before it
touches anything.

Ask it things in plain language:

- "Make the dock icons smaller."
- "Why is my laptop fan always running?"
- "Set up a Python project with uv in ~/code/scraper."
- "Add a hotkey that opens Mission Center."
- "Make a top bar widget that shows the weather." See [Widgets](widgets.md).

It starts in its normal mode, so it asks before it runs a command or changes a file. Read what it
proposes before you say yes. Opencode's own normal mode asks for almost nothing, so started from here it
asks before a command, an edit and a web fetch, unless your own `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` sets a
`permission`, which then wins.

A repository someone else wrote can tell an agent what to do as it opens: before you start one in a
folder you cloned, read its `.claude/`, `.mcp.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json`, if it has them. Each can
name commands the agent or your editor will run, or servers it will talk to, as you.

## What it can do

The agent comes with tools of Amethystora's own, which it uses in place of reading whole pages and
running commands one by one. There are two levels, each turned on by you, for your account:

| Level | What the agent can do | How it asks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agentic features** (`ame agent toggle on`) | Search this manual and the image's own reference of commands, services and settings; read this machine's state (updates, settings, security, apps, disks, backups, failed services, crashes) and its logs; see what it changed before | It does not ask: these only read |
| **Let the agent make changes** (`ame agent tools on`) | Set Amethystora's settings as Control does, install and remove apps (Flatpaks for you, Homebrew, containers), hand you commands to run, as root too, and undo what it changed | Before every change, in the agent; a command that asks questions opens in a terminal, where you read it and say yes |

The second level needs the first. Some things the agent may never do, whatever you allow: anything about
a duress finger or password, loosening a security setting or turning on one that sends something away,
deleting from a backup or a snapshot, erasing a disk, turning the AUR on, or changing its own lock or root
mode. It names such a command, and you run it yourself. It runs a security command only when you ask, and
only one that turns protection on.

The tools only work while the agent was started from here (`Super+Ctrl+Shift+A`, the menu or
`amethystora-agent`), except in Cursor CLI and Antigravity CLI, whose own settings hold them while the
features are on. An agent started with its own checks turned off (such as `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
gets no tool that changes anything.

## Turning it on and off

The agent features are off on a new machine and for every new account, and an update turned them
off for every account that had them on, which a notification said once. Each account turns them on
for itself: `ame agent toggle on` adds the menu entries, the hotkey and the **Ask the agent** buttons,
and links the skill; `ame agent toggle off` takes them away again, and changes with them. An agent you
installed stays installed either way.

## Diagnose a problem

**Diagnose a problem** in the Amethystora menu (`Super+Alt+Space`) hands the agent something that
went wrong: a crash, a failed service, or your own description ("Wi-Fi drops after suspend"). It
investigates from the logs and crash reports, changes nothing, and comes back with the cause and a
proposed fix.

```bash
amethystora-agent diagnose                       # look for anything that failed recently
amethystora-agent diagnose "wifi drops after suspend"
amethystora-agent diagnose NetworkManager.service
amethystora-agent diagnose 4242                  # a process ID
```

The apps hand it what went wrong where you see it go wrong: **Ask the agent why** in **Updates** when
an update did not finish, **Ask the agent** in **Security** beside anything that needs your attention,
and **Ask the agent** in **Logs** beside a crash or something a service wrote. They pass on only the
service, the process number or the report's own words, and the agent reads the rest itself. While the
agent features are off, the buttons are not there.

`ame system doctor` is the health check the agent starts from: failed services, updates, disk space,
memory, crashes, the clock, the driver, backups and pools of disks, each finding with the guide that
fixes it. It reads only, and you can run it yourself; `ame system doctor ID` checks one thing again after
a fix.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `amethystora-agent` | Open the agent (the same as `Super+Ctrl+Shift+A`) |
| `amethystora-agent ask "<question>"` | Open it with a first question |
| `amethystora-agent diagnose [...]` | Find out why something broke, changing nothing |
| `amethystora-agent use <agent>` | Choose the agent: `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `agy`, `copilot` or `cursor-agent`; also `ame agent use` |
| `amethystora-agent install [<agent>]` | Install the chosen agent ahead of time, or the one named without choosing it; also `ame agent install` |
| `amethystora-agent list` | Each agent, and whether it is installed |
| `amethystora-agent status` | Whether the agent features are on for your account, and which agent |
| `ame agent toggle on` | Turn the agent features on for your account, or `off` again |
| `ame agent tools on` | Let the agent make changes, asking each time, or `off` again |
| `ame agent history [ID]` | What the agent changed, or one change and how it ended |
| `ame agent lock`, `ame agent root` | What your account may turn on, the lock and the root mode, changing nothing; also `amethystora-agent policy` |
| `amethystora-agent search "<question>"` | Search the manual and the image's reference as the agent does; `-k N` gives N passages instead of 4 |
| `amethystora-agent read ID` | Read a whole passage a search found, by its id |
| `amethystora-agent state TOPIC` | This machine's state as the agent reads it: `overview`, `health`, `settings`, `security`, `security-settings`, `app-permissions`, `software`, `updates`, `backups`, `disks`, `setup-diff`, `units` or `crashes` |

`toggle` and `tools` without `on` or `off` switch to the other. The search, `read`, `state` and the history work
only while the agent features are on. [Control](control.md)'s **AI agent** page has the same switches and
choice, and installs the chosen agent.

## Root commands

When you let the agent make changes, a command it needs to run as root asks you first in the agent, and
then as an administrator chose in [Control](control.md)'s **AI agent** page, for every account:

| Mode | What your password gives |
| --- | --- |
| **Once per agent session** (`session`, the default) | One password; then root commands run until the agent ends, the screen locks, or an hour passes without one |
| **For five minutes** (`minutes`) | One password, then five minutes for that agent alone |
| **Every time** (`each`) | A password for every command |
| **In a terminal** (`terminal`) | Each command opens in a terminal, where you read it and type your password for `sudo` |

`ame agent root MODE` changes it. Every root command shows a notification and is written to the journal
(`journalctl -t amethystora-agent-root`). A command that asks questions always opens in a terminal.

## The lock

An administrator can cap what any account may turn on, in Control or with `ame agent lock act|know|off`:
`act` allows both levels, `know` only the agent and its read-only tools, `off` nothing. One account can
have its own, `ame agent lock ACCOUNT know`, and `ame agent lock ACCOUNT default` puts it back. The lock
governs Amethystora's agent features; it is not a sandbox, and for a child's account Parental Controls'
app filter is the stronger tool. Both settings are in `/etc/amethystora/agent.conf`.

## History and undo

Every change the agent's tools make is recorded, with what it was before and how to undo it:
`ame agent history`, or **What the agent changed** in Control. Undo one yourself with `ame agent undo ID`,
or ask the agent to. A command it handed you has no undo of its own: the agent can tell you what would
reverse it.

## Its changes in the live pill

While the agent may make changes and runs, the live pill in the middle of the top bar says so as soon as
it changes something: **Agent · changing settings**, **Agent asks for root** while it waits for your
password or your yes in a terminal, and **Agent made 3 changes** for ten minutes after it ends. Click the
pill to see each change: what it was, the command or the app, and when, with its own **Undo**. **Undo
all** takes them back, the latest first. **Stop the agent** ends its tools now (`ame agent stop` does the
same); a change already under way, such as an install, finishes, and some agents start their tools again, so
close the agent itself to be sure it changes nothing more. **History** opens the whole record.

Undo is your own yes, and goes through the agent's own tools: an undo they refuse (a setting no longer
offered, a record whose way back does not match what it says it did) is refused, and the row says why. The
agent's tools will not turn this list off: `ame agent pill off` does, and is yours to run.

## Asking about a selection

Select text in any window, an error in a terminal, a paragraph on a web page, a line in a log, and press
`Super+Shift+A`. A card shows the start of what you selected, with a field for your question (leave it
empty to have it explained), **Cancel** and **Ask**. Ask opens the agent in a terminal with your question,
and with the text as data: the agent is told it was written by someone else and never to follow what it
says, since selected text can carry instructions written to steer an agent. Up to 4,000 characters of it
are passed on, each line at most 600; nothing is read before you press the keys, and nothing is kept.

It works only while the agentic features are on. `ame agent selection off` turns the key off.

## Notices that offer the agent

While the agentic features are on, the image's own notices of something that failed, a security scan
that could not run and a device the driver check found without a driver, have an **Ask the agent**
button. It opens the agent on the failed service or the check's finding, by its name, never on the
notice's words. Other apps' notifications never get the button: anyone can raise a notification, and
its words could be written to steer the agent.

## Installing and updating

The agents are not part of the image, because they release far more often than it does. The first
time you open one, it offers to install it into your home with its maker's own installer. From then
on it keeps itself up to date, and you can update it yourself: `claude update`, `opencode upgrade`,
`codex update`, `agy update`, `copilot update` or `cursor-agent update`. Claude Code is installed on its stable
channel, a release about a week old. Because it lives in your home, the same copy also works inside
any toolbox or distrobox.

Antigravity CLI (`agy`) is Google's agent, in place of Gemini CLI. A Gemini CLI you already chose and
installed still opens, and `ame update` upgrades it with the rest of your Homebrew apps; to move,
choose `agy`. Antigravity's installer also adds `~/.local/bin` to your shell's `PATH` in your shell's
startup files.

## Privacy

No agent does anything until you sign in to it, and what you send it goes to the provider you
signed in to. So does what its tools answer: the search runs on this machine, but the passages,
the machine's state and the log lines the agent reads go to that provider like anything else it reads.
Nothing personal is in the search's index: not your files, not the journal.
