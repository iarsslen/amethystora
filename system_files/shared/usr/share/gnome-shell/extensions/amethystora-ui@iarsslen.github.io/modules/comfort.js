// Comfort: what the desktop does for people who need it calmer or clearer. Reduce motion is GNOME's own reduced
// motion setting, which GTK and libadwaita apps follow as well (ame desktop comfort reduce-motion, Control); GNOME's
// Animations switch turned off counts as reduce motion too. Increase contrast is GNOME's own High Contrast, so that
// the desktop and the apps agree. The power saver is the profile power-profiles-daemon's interface says is active
// (tuned-ppd answers it on this image): while it is on, the glass is solid and animations take half their time.
// Nothing here decides when any of them is on and it has no setting of its own: it only listens, to one of GNOME's
// keys, two of its shell settings and one property on the system bus, and costs nothing in between.
//
// GNOME turns its animations off by itself where the screen is drawn without a GPU (a virtual machine without
// acceleration, some remote desktops) and while the screen is shared remotely: there, reduce motion is on whatever
// the switch says, since nothing is animated anyway.
//
// For the other modules (the dock, the glass, the windows, the motion, the animations' speed in tweaks):
//
//   const comfort = this._ext.modules.get('comfort');
//   comfort?.reduceMotion   true while GNOME's reduced motion is 'reduce' or its animations are off: an animation
//                           that moves an actor (translation, scale, a path) becomes a crossfade in place of at most
//                           150 ms
//   comfort?.highContrast   true while GNOME's High Contrast is on
//   comfort?.powerSaver     true while the power-saver profile is active
//   const unlisten = comfort?.listen(c => ...);
//                           the callback runs once for each change of any of the three, with this object; the
//                           function returned takes it away again. Call it in your disable(). Calling it after
//                           comfort itself has stopped is harmless.
//
// Comfort starts before tweaks and every module with motion, and stops after them.
