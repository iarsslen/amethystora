// What the desktop keeps to itself, and what it shows of the machine's protection (plans/beyond/spec-r4-privacy.md):
//
//  - the share guard: while the whole screen is shared, the windows of chosen apps (Notes, Security, Backups, password
//    managers) and Files windows in the Private folder are covered, blurred or with a solid card (privacy/guard.js);
//  - the shield: a tile in quick settings, or a mark in the top bar, that says how the machine's protection stands and
//    opens Security for every line of it; it switches nothing (privacy/shield.js);
//  - network by app, offered and off: the network meter's menu lists which apps are talking to the network, and to
//    where, only while it is open (privacy/connections.js);
//  - walk-away lock, a security switch (WALK_AWAY in /etc/amethystora/security.conf, off): the screen locks when the
//    paired phone has left and the computer is left alone; it never unlocks (privacy/away.js).
//
// Each part exists only while its key (or, for walk-away lock, a phone leaving) asks for it, and idles on signals: no
// timer runs while nothing happens. The keys are org.gnome.shell.extensions.amethystora-ui.privacy, written by ame
// desktop share-guard, shield and network-apps, Control and the setup file.
//
// For the VM suite: state(), and the parts by their getters.
